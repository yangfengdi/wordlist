When I was in the fifth grade, I completed my first science project. My teacher did not like it. She told me and my partner that we should wait another year to enter the science fair. I felt so discouraged.

I started thinking about my next project. I wanted to find a problem I cared about. I played the piano. So I wondered how the piano could make sounds. I did my next project on this. The project won first place at the fair.

My name is Clara. I am 22 years old, and I am now a scientist. I study the climate, or weather patterns over a long period of time, usually 30 years or more.

I have often wondered how to be a good scientist. To me, it is the same as what it takes to be a good person.

Patience

A good scientist has patience. A few years ago, I worked on a NASA mission. We sent a spacecraft to get samples from an asteroid in space. Asteroids are rocky objects. They orbit, or travel around, the sun. The spacecraft took off four years ago. In 2021, it will bring a piece of the asteroid back to Earth. The mission will take five years in total.

Scientific discoveries do not happen overnight. Many are small and go step-by-step. Missions often take years to complete. That is why patience is so important.

Success almost never comes quickly or easily. Chances are, you'll make a lot of errors. That is OK. Making mistakes is a part of learning.

Being Open To Others

A good scientist has an open mind. We should ask people what they think. We should listen to others even if we do not agree. We should also learn from our mistakes.

Good scientists are curious. Good people are curious, too. When we are curious about people, it can make us more understanding.

So, ask questions about everything. Ask your friends how they are doing. Ask yourself what you love to do. Above all, pay attention to the world. Pay attention to the people around you.

Do not be ashamed of being curious. It is our superpower. It is also what makes us human. All we have to do is ask.

A good scientist has patience.  Discoveries do not happen quickly. Some take many years.

Success also does not come quickly. It does not come easily. You will make a lot of mistakes. That is OK. Making mistakes is part of learning.

A good scientist has an open mind. That means being open to new ideas. This is true even when we do not agree with others.

Of course, good scientists are curious. So be curious too.

Ask questions. Ask your friends how they are doing. Ask yourself what you love to do. Above all, pay attention to the world and the people around you.

Luke Bannister feels like a bird.

He is really a drone pilot. Luke is only 16.

Drones can fly. They are like planes with no pilots. They can be big or small. The kinds of drones that Luke flies are small.

Luke is not inside his drone. He is on the ground with a controller. He wears a headset. It is hooked up to a camera on the drone. It lets him see all around the drone.

This is called first-person view, or FPV. It makes Luke feel like he is in the drone.

Some Drones Are As Fast As Cars

Drones are becoming popular. They carry mail and make videos. Now they are a sport, too.

There are drone races. People fly their drones against one another. Racing drones is like racing cars in some ways.

Luke flies his drone at a park. He set up a course for his drone to fly around. This is how he practices.

His drone is small and light. It is fast, though. It can fly as fast as a car drives.

Luke wears a headset. He says it makes him feel like he is inside the drone. He thinks it is like flying in a fighter jet.

Teen Becomes A World Champion

Luke has liked flying for a long time. He first flew remote-controlled planes.

He has only been flying drones for a few years. He won the world's biggest drone race.

His prize was $250,000. This is more money than most grown-ups make in one year.

Luke still goes to school. He uses his free time to work on his drones.

Luke knows he still must do his schoolwork. School will help him with his biggest dream. He wants to fly a real plane. Luke hopes to be a pilot one day.

Look up: Cars can fly in the sky!

Have you ever wished for a flying car? It is a fun idea! Picture yourself zipping through the skies. This is exciting to imagine.

Some companies are working on this idea. They are making real flying cars. These cars are not for everyone, however. They are very pricey. Also, you must be a pilot to fly one.

A company called AeroMobil has a new flying car. The company displayed it last week. The car looks like a tiny plane. It has wings. They fold down like a bug's wings.

Flying Car Can Go 99 Miles Per Hour!

The AeroMobil is very fast. Its top speed is 99 miles per hour! Turning the car into a plane is also quick. This takes about 3 minutes.

The car will go on sale later this year. People can sign up to buy one. They will need a lot of money. The car costs more than $1 million.

Buyers will also need a special license. Only people with a pilot license can fly the car. This license lets you fly airplanes. Others are not allowed. They can only drive the car.

Many companies are building flying cars. They are working on all different kinds. Some cars need a long runway. They zoom down it to take off. The AeroMobil is one of these. Other cars can go straight up into the air. They lift up like a helicopter.

Philip Mawby is a teacher. He works at a college in England. Mawby said companies know how to build flying cars. They have the technology. But the cars cost a lot of money to build. That is why they are so pricey.

Cost And Safety

Getting the cost down is a problem, Mawby said. Companies must solve it. If they can't, hardly anyone will buy their cars.

Another problem is safety. Right now, there are not many planes in the sky. It is mostly big airline planes up there. What if there were suddenly many flying cars in the air at once? It would be dangerous. The flying cars could crash.

In 2014, AeroMobil showed another flying car. It crashed in a test flight in 2015. The man who invented it was in the car. He was not harmed.
