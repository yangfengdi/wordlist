Spider silk is amazing. It is very strong. It is one of the strongest things found in nature. Spider silk is even stronger than steel! It is also very stretchy. Scientists have been trying to make spider silk. They have been working on it for years.

Now, they have succeeded. Scientists in England have made a new kind of thread. It is an artificial spider silk. The thread is very strong and stretchy. It could be used to make better products. For example, it could make bike helmets stronger. The thread is amazing for another reason: it is mostly made of water.

Comes From A Hydrogel

Darshil Shah is a scientist. He helped make the new thread. The thread comes from something called a hydrogel. It is mostly water. It also has silica and cellulose. These are natural materials. Silica is found in rocks. Cellulose is found in plants. Scientists can pull the silica and cellulose from the hydrogel. This turns them into thread.

What Can It Be Used For?

The thread is very strong. It could be used for many things. For example, it could be used for protection. The thread can be made into clothing. This clothing could help protect soldiers. The thread could be used in hot air balloons. It could be used to make stronger helmets.

Trying To Make Larger Amounts

Darshil did not work alone. He is part of a team of scientists. They are proud of their work. But there are still some problems. It is not easy to make the thread. Right now, the scientists can only make small amounts. They are still learning how to make more.

Currently, the scientists are building a robot. The robot may solve their problem. It will help them make the thread more quickly.

The scientists have had some success. But there is more work to do. They are still trying to make improvements.

MILWAUKEE, Wis. — A drone is a remote-controlled airplane. It has a camera. It takes pictures or video from the air. A computer can steer the drone. A person on the ground can fly it.

Zach Fiene once spent hours walking through farm fields. He looked for sick plants and bugs. He looked for dry spots. Now he just flies a drone.

A drone can tell him that information in minutes.

Drones Are Helpers

Zach owns DMZ Aerial with his cousin. It is a company that uses drones to help farmers.

Drones can get information about crops. They tell farmers where to put weed killer. Drones can also tell farmers where to water.

It can take a lot of time to walk through a field. Farmers can still miss something, Zach said.

Farmers might walk past a problem area. They may not even see it. Then later, the farmer's corn is dead, he said.

New Rules Are Needed

The Federal Aviation Administration is in charge of the skies. It is writing new rules for drones. These rules would let businesses use drones.

Pilots worry that some drones are too small. Pilots cannot see them, said Andrew Moore. He works with the National Agricultural Aviation Association. Drones can cause crashes.

Andrew’s group wants to put lights on drones. Lights would help airplane pilots spot them.

Flying A Drone Can Be Fun

There are other problems. Drones can take pictures of people from above. The people would never know.

Landmark Cooperative Services is a farming business in Wisconsin. It uses drones and people. First a drone flies over a farm. It might find a problem. Then a crop scout takes a closer look.

Drones are fun, said Chase Sellnow. He works at Landmark.

They make work less boring.

Everybody wants to fly a drone, Chase said.

When I was in the fifth grade, I completed my first science project. My teacher did not like it. She told me and my partner that we should wait another year to enter the science fair. I felt so discouraged.

I started thinking about my next project. I wanted to find a problem I cared about. I played the piano. So I wondered how the piano could make sounds. I did my next project on this. The project won first place at the fair.

My name is Clara. I am 22 years old, and I am now a scientist. I study the climate, or weather patterns over a long period of time, usually 30 years or more.

I have often wondered how to be a good scientist. To me, it is the same as what it takes to be a good person.

Patience

A good scientist has patience. A few years ago, I worked on a NASA mission. We sent a spacecraft to get samples from an asteroid in space. Asteroids are rocky objects. They orbit, or travel around, the sun. The spacecraft took off four years ago. In 2021, it will bring a piece of the asteroid back to Earth. The mission will take five years in total.

Scientific discoveries do not happen overnight. Many are small and go step-by-step. Missions often take years to complete. That is why patience is so important.

Success almost never comes quickly or easily. Chances are, you'll make a lot of errors. That is OK. Making mistakes is a part of learning.

Being Open To Others

A good scientist has an open mind. We should ask people what they think. We should listen to others even if we do not agree. We should also learn from our mistakes.

Good scientists are curious. Good people are curious, too. When we are curious about people, it can make us more understanding.

So, ask questions about everything. Ask your friends how they are doing. Ask yourself what you love to do. Above all, pay attention to the world. Pay attention to the people around you.

Do not be ashamed of being curious. It is our superpower. It is also what makes us human. All we have to do is ask.

Have you heard of a blue-footed booby? It is a kind of bird. It has bright blue feet. Sometimes this bird does a silly dance. It lifts one blue foot. Then it lifts the other.

The blue-footed booby is in danger. These birds are slowly dying out.

Will Gladstone learned about the blue-footed booby when he was in the fifth grade. He wanted to help the birds. So he started foundation. A foundation is a group that gives money to help someone or something. Will's group is called the Blue Feet Foundation. His brother Matty helped him start it.

Will's big idea was to make blue socks. They are the same color as the birds' feet! Will and Matty sell the socks. Then they donate the money they make. The give it to groups that are trying to save the birds.

Raising Money To Help The Birds

Today, Will is 16 years old. His foundation is a success. Will and Matty have sold 25,000 pairs of socks. They have raised over $130,000!

Some of the money goes to scientists. They are studying the blue-footed booby. They travel to the Galapagos Islands to see the birds. The blue-footed booby lives on these islands. They are part of Ecuador, a country in South America.

Will got to go to the Galapagos, too. He went on a school trip. He saw a live blue-footed booby in the wild there. He said it was awesome to see one!

Indonesia is a country in Asia. One of its islands is home to a kind of bird called a bird-of-paradise. The male birds have beautiful feathers. To find love, they do a curious thing. They hop and spin. They dance through the trees. They show off their wings. Female birds watch them. If the male bird dances well enough, they will become parents together.

Few people have gotten to see this dance. The birds fly too high.

Photographing The Bird-Of-Paradise Dance

Tim Laman is a photographer. He wanted to take pictures of the bird-of-paradise dance. Laman teamed up with a scientist. His name was Ed Scholes. They traveled together for eight years. There are 39 different birds in the bird-of-paradise family. Laman and Scholes set off to see them all.

It was not easy to record the birds' dances. First, Laman and Scholes had to find a male bird's dance tree. Then, they had to find a way to take pictures without bothering the birds. Laman left a camera near the top of the tree. He hid it in a jacket made of leaves. Then he he built a hiding place for himself. He stuck that in another tree nearby. From there, he was able to see the bird's dance. He used an extra-long cable to connect the camera to his laptop. This let him take pictures from his hiding place.

Early Wake-Up Calls

Laman waited for the birds. He would wake up early to look for them. Then one morning, a bird-of-paradise flew by him. The bird spread out its feathers. It was an amazing sight. Laman and Scholes were thrilled. The journey had been worth it.

Laman sat in his hiding place recording the dance. He wasn't the only one watching. Soon a female bird arrived. The male saw her. He started to bounce and flap his wings. The female was not sure that she would choose him. Even so, he definitely caught her eye.

Green sea turtles are small when they are born. They get much bigger as they get older. Their diets change, too. Adults mostly eat plants. They munch on seaweeds. But young turtles eat other animals. One of their favorites is jellyfish.

Most animals are scared of jellyfish. They will not go near them. Jellyfish can sting. It is very painful! But young turtles are not afraid. Jellyfish do not seem to hurt them.

In the photo above, a young turtle swims in the sea. It floats above a jellyfish. The turtle has already taken a few bites. Now the jellyfish looks different. It has a new shape. It can no longer float! The turtle has to hold it up. If it lets go, it will lose its meal.

Healthy Jelly Meal

 Zoom-out
The yellow dot shows the location of the Similan Islands. This group of islands is part of Thailand. It is where the photographer Richard Carey took the sea turtle photo above. Photo: Richard Carey.
The turtle is lucky. The jellyfish is full of nutrients. It will make a healthy meal. Too often, sea turtles mistake plastic bags for jellyfish. This is dangerous. Plastic has no nutrients. But worse, eating plastic can make a turtle sick. It can even be deadly.

There is a lot of plastic in the ocean. This is bad for sea turtles. Many of them end up eating it.

Reducing Waste

Some people are trying to help. They want to get rid of plastic bags. This is partly to help turtles. It is also to reduce waste.

A few cities have passed laws to help. These laws stop stores from using plastic bags. Shoppers now have to bring their own bags. They use reusable bags instead. These are better for the planet. They help reduce waste. Now fewer bags end up in the ocean. That helps turtles.

It seems to be working. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is a government group. It keeps track of animals. The group has been studying green sea turtles near Florida and Mexico.

This spring, the group made an announcement. It said there are more turtles living near Florida and Mexico now. There were not as many turtles before. The population is growing.

That is great news. It means the turtles are not in danger of dying out.

Editor's Note: After this interview was published, Jerome Foster II became part of a special group. That group will work with the president of the United States. They will talk about how the environment affects people of color and areas with less money. Foster is the youngest member of the group.

Jerome Foster II is 18. He is in college. But he is an activist, too. He works for causes he believes in. He has been working with young people for many years. He began OneMillionOfUs. The group helps young people take action. Read on to hear how he got started.

Question: How did you get started as an activist?

Foster: My parents were activists. I started young.

Climate change was always important to me. The world's temperature is changing a lot. It can be really warm or really cool.  People are to blame for some of it. In school, my classmates did not know about climate change.

I wanted to teach my classmates about it.  I started a page on Instagram. It is a social media site. That was in middle school. I did more in high school.

Q: What were your first moves to work on climate change?

Foster: I went to the mayor's office in Washington, D.C. I was the only young person there! I spoke for the Clean Energy D.C. Act. It is a law. It cuts down on greenhouse gases. Climate change will get worse if greenhouse gases are not cut down.

After that, I started the first climate strike in the United States. It was in 2019. More than 300 people showed up!

In 10 years, our air and water may be worse. It may be too hot or too cold to live in certain places, too. We have to care. We have to act.

Q: What's a climate strike?

Foster: A climate strike is a big meeting. You get a group together. You stand in front of a government building. You hold signs and sing. You talk to people about climate change. You may speak to leaders about the climate.

Q: How did OneMillionOfUs get started?

Foster: Voting is important for young people. I wanted to get 1 million young people excited to vote. We need to vote. It gives us a say on the causes we care about.

Q: What are some things OneMillionOfUs has done?

We did a bus tour through West Philadelphia. We got people of color and young people excited to vote. We put together "Chalk the Vote." Young people used chalk on the ground and on school buildings. They wrote messages about what they care about. It happened across the country.
