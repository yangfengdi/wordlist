Our world is full of plastic. There are plastic bottles. There are plastic bags. Even our clothes are made of plastic. Fabrics like polyester are made from thin plastic fibers. Since plastics are everywhere, it means microplastics are everywhere.

Microplastics are small pieces of plastic. They are less than 5 millimeters (0.2 inches) long. They form when plastic objects start to slowly break down. Microplastic pollution is in the ocean. It is in the air.

Now, it even reached the peak of Mount Everest. Scientists reported their work in November 2020.

The Snow On Mount Everest Contains Plastics

Mount Everest is Earth's highest mountain. It is a very remote place. It is difficult to access. Once, it was clean and the snow was pure. But today, it has a nickname as the "world's highest junkyard." Tourists and climbers have left their trash behind.

Imogen Napper is a scientist. She works at the University of Plymouth in England. Napper tested snow collected from Everest. There were microplastics in every portion she tested.

Napper was shocked! How could the tiny plastics reach so high? Mount Everest is 8,850 meters tall. That is about 29,035 feet. Think of how big the Empire State Building is. Now think of 20 stacked on top of each other. That's about the height of Mount Everest.

Studying The Impact of Microplastic Pollution

Microplastics are harmful to the environment. They're very small. This makes them difficult to clean up. They are also small enough that some animals can easily eat them.

It is important to know where the microplastic comes from. Napper thinks most of the plastic comes from the clothing. Fabrics break down as people climb the mountain.  Some of it could come from somewhere else. Everest also has strong winds. Microplastics are light. The wind could carry them up the mountain. The wind can carry them from further away.

Napper's worried about all the microplastics in the environment. Microplastics have been found deep in the ocean. And now they're on the highest mountain on Earth. "These are the highest microplastics discovered so far," says Napper.

She says it is time to fix this problem. "We need to protect and care for our planet," she says.

Diana Zendejo is a scientist. Her research focuses on protecting bears. Zendejo also wants to help people get along with them. To do this, she is learning from people who live near the bears.

Zendejo is a student at the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon. It is in Mexico. There, she studies ecological restoration. This is a science that focuses on recovering damaged or destroyed environments.

Now, she works in northern Mexico, in an area where many farmers raise cows. But this area is also home to the biggest group of Mexico's largest bear: the black bear.

The people who live near these animals often know a lot about them. But for years, Zendejo says, scientists ignored their human neighbors. So, she wants to work with these local communities. By copying how people get along with black bears, we can help other farmers, too, Zendejo says.

Farming, Nature, And Conflict

Zendejo learned to love wildlife at a young age. She grew up in southern Mexico. Her family and friends told her stories about animals. "They were my first professors and inspiration," she said.

At college, Zendejo was able to connect with other bear scientists. Today, she works in Coahuila. It is a state in northeast Mexico. She explained that there are two main reasons for the conflicts between bears and people in the area: food and water.

Every year, bears hibernate. This is a process where an animal passes the winter in a resting state. They spend most of this time sleeping. It helps them save energy. But before hibernating, black bears build up fat by eating lots of food.

Human food is an easy way to fill up. The hungry bears eat human garbage. They sometimes eat food from farms. Zendejo says they see this food like "a kid sees a candy store."

These bears also live in dry areas. Some animals get water from their food. But, just like humans, bears need to drink water directly. In dry seasons, bears move into cities to find water.

In the future, climate change may cause stronger dry seasons in this area. Climate change is the significant change in the climate of Earth. It happens over a long period of time. Climate change could make life harder for black bears. It could cause more problems between bears and people.

Living With Bears

Now Zendejo is living her "bear-dream." She started a project called "Walking With Bears." She is working with an anthropologist. This is a scientist who studies human beings. Together, they are talking to farmers who live near bears. These people can teach others about being good neighbors to black bears.

Her other work involves taking photos. Her pictures show how scientists work to save animals. They show how people are trying to live with bears.

Zendejo hopes her work will help make life better for Mexico's black bears. It can also help people. Different types of scientists can learn from each other during this process.

Alexander White and Amelie Neate live in Sydney, New South Wales. They found a baby snake in a bag of lettuce. It gave them quite a fright.

They bought the lettuce from the supermarket. The snake was sleeping inside the lettuce bag. White picked it up, then carried it around the store. He put it in his backpack for the ride home. "We didn't have a trolley so we were just carrying it," White said.

The couple found the snake when they got home. It came out of the bag while they were putting the shopping away. It was 20 centimetres long. That's about as long as a dinner fork. "It was moving around and flicking its little tongue out," said White.

The couple took a lot of photos of the snake. Then, they called wildlife rescue group WIRES. A snake expert helped them work out what kind of snake it was. It was identified as a young pale-headed snake.

The snake expert said that pale-headed snakes were "medically significant". That means they are venomous. "If you are bitten you have to go to hospital," White said.

White was worried there might be more snakes. He looked through all the shopping, but there was only the one. "It looked quite at home in the lettuce," White said. It looked around for a while, then "it went back inside the lettuce and fell asleep".

Snake Goes Home, Lettuce Becomes Lunch

A snake handler from WIRES came to pick up the animal. WIRES rang the supermarket. Together, they traced the lettuce back to Toowoomba. It is a region in southern Queensland. WIRES is now trying to organise transport home for the snake. It will be released into the wild.

WIRES left the lettuce behind. White ate it for lunch. He washed it first, however. "There were a couple of things that I had determined to be snake poo but I washed that off and had a salad wrap," he said.

Crested rats can kill with their poisonous fur

African crested rats are fuzzy and cute. But do not let their adorable faces fool you. Their fur is packed with a powerful poison. These are substances that cause harm to living things. The poison is so deadly that just a tiny amount can kill.

History Of Crested Rats

The rats are about the size of rabbits and live in woodlands in eastern Africa. They were first described in 1867. Scientists suspected they were poisonous. But it was hard to figure out where the poison came from. Crested rats are difficult to catch and observe.

In November 2020, scientists reported new observations of the rats' behavior in a scientific journal. They caught 25 crested rats in Kenya. They put cameras in the animals' pens. Then, they looked at nearly 1,000 hours of footage. The scientists found that the rats don't make the poison themselves. Instead, they get it from a plant called poison arrow trees. The trees contain chemicals that are very dangerous for most animals.

Crested rats first chew pieces of the tree bark to mix it with their saliva. Then, they brush the spit mixture onto hairs along their sides. It acts as a defense against predators that attack by biting. This includes animals such as hyenas, jackals and leopards. These animals bite crested rats where the poison is, causing them to die.

The rats don't seem to get sick from the poison. This could be because of their unusual stomachs. They contain a lot of different bacteria. Some of the bacteria may break up the poison and keep the rats from getting sick.

New Information About Crested Rats

Looking at the footage, the scientists made more discoveries. They used to think that the rats lived alone. So, they were surprised to learn that the rats lived in bonded male-female pairs. The rats spent more than half of their time together and communicated with sounds that included squeaks and purrs.

The crested rat is rarely seen in the wild. So scientists aren't sure of their population numbers. They're also unsure about their risk of extinction or dying out. More humans have been invading and changing the rats' habitat, or the natural environment where they live. So, risks to the animals have grown over the past ten years.

"We are looking at a broad range of questions influenced by habitat change," says Bernard Agwanda. He is the curator of mammals at the Museums of Kenya. He also worked on the research. "We need to understand how that impacts their survival."

Washington, D.C., statehood bill passes House, but Senate hopes are dim

The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill called the Washington, D.C. Admission Act on April 22. It could make Washington, D.C., the 51st state of the United States. The U.S. is made up of 50 states.

Washington is the capital of the U.S. Right now, D.C. is considered a "special federal district." Because of this, its citizens can't vote for either U.S. senators or representatives. Those groups make up the two chambers of Congress. They are the lawmaking bodies for the U.S.

That would change if D.C. became a state.

However, the bill's journey is far from over.

The House Vote

For a bill to be passed into law, it must first be approved by a majority of the House of Representatives. Then it must pass in the Senate.

The Democrats and Republicans are the two major U.S. political groups. Right now the Senate is split. There are 48 Democrats, two independents who usually vote with the Democrats, and 50 Republicans.

All the Democratic lawmakers in the House voted in favor of D.C. statehood. No Republicans joined them.

Washington Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton watched over the vote. She wore a mask. It had "51" written on it.

When the bill passed, one person cheered. The celebration felt small. Supporters know they must face the Senate filibuster. A filibuster is when a lawmaker gives a long speech. The lawmaker stops the Senate from being able to do its normal business.

"A Rather Dark Turn"

Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, supports the bill. He praised the House action April 22. Schumer noted the fact that D.C. residents pay taxes. They serve in the military. To him, that means they deserve statehood.

The debate over D.C. statehood has "taken a rather dark turn," he said. Schumer said Republicans had no real argument against statehood. He said instead they're attacking D.C.'s residents. Nearly half of its residents are Black.

Still, Schumer did not say if the bill will be voted on in the Senate.

What is a vegetarian? What is a vegan? How are they different?

A vegetarian does not eat meat. This includes beef and seafood. A vegan does not eat any food that comes from animals. This includes eggs and milk.

Many kids are trying this.

Annie Kay is 13 years old. She lives in Canada. She felt bad when she learned that meat comes from animals. So she stopped eating it.

Healthy And Good For The Earth
Max Murphy is 8 years old. He also lives in Canada. He has always been a vegan. He wants to protect all animals.

There are many good things about not eating meat. First, it can be healthy. But you need to plan your meals. Kids must get enough nutrients to grow. Your doctor can help.

Not eating meat also helps the Earth. It cuts down on harmful gases in the air. These gases make the planet too warm.

Try Not Eating Meat
Some people do not eat meat on Mondays. It is a way to try being a vegan or vegetarian. You can try, too!

You can eat foods like beans and tofu. These are similar to meat.

You can drink oat milk or soy milk. These do not come from cows.

Eat lots of vegetables and fruit. And drink lots of water!

Butterflies do not fly in a straight line. They flutter about when they fly. This helps them get away quickly. Now scientists in Sweden know how they do it.

Butterflies clap their wings above them when they take off. This causes jet propulsion. That is when something shoots out a liquid or gas, like air. That gives it a push in the opposite direction. Aircraft use jet propulsion to get off the ground. And now, scientists know that butterflies do this, too. In January, scientists published their findings.

Studying Butterflies
Christoffer Johansson and Per Henningsson are scientists. They study how animals fly. They work at Lund University. It is in Sweden.

The scientists caught six butterflies. They placed them inside a wind tunnel. In a wind tunnel, fans blow air. The air flows around anything in the tunnel. The scientists also added drops of oil to the air. This makes a harmless "smoke." It makes it easier to see how the air flows. The scientists also used a laser to light up the smoke.

Then, the scientists placed cameras in the tunnel. This helped them take pictures of the butterflies taking off. They saw how the wings moved. They saw how the air moved when the butterfly's wings flapped.

The Vortex
The scientists watched six butterflies take off a total of 25 times. They saw that the butterflies clapped their wings. The insects did this more at the beginning of the takeoff.

Image 2. Jet propulsion in a balloon. Graphic: Newsela staff.

The pictures showed the air spinning. The butterflies' wings made a vortex (a vortex is when air or water spins around very quickly.)

The photos also showed that the wings pushed the air down. This made a force that pushed the butterfly up (a force is a push or pull in one direction). The wings moved up to clap. They made an air pocket. This made a strong jet of air. It shot out behind the butterfly. That jet-propelled the butterfly forward.

This is why butterflies flutter about. It helps keep them from getting caught and eaten.

Scientists thought they knew how the clap worked before. But Henningsson says it's "far more advanced and sophisticated" than they realized.

Katheryn Collins loves small pets. And, she knows a lot about them.

Katheryn lives in Maryland. She will be 16 in May. In January, she started a new group. It is called Petites Pattes Rescue. Petites Pattes means "little paws" in French. It cares for unwanted gerbils, hamsters and mice. She also teaches people how to care for small pets.

Many small animals live in bad homes, Katheryn said. They need to be rescued. Also, some pet stores give bad advice. They sell hamster wheels and tubes that are too small. The tubes are uncomfortable for hamsters. The wheels can hurt their backs.

In January,  she rescued her first pet. It was a hamster. She named it Pluto. It quickly found a new home.

Since then, she has rescued more. Several animals have been adopted.

Katheryn would like to rescue bigger pets. For now, she will stick to the little guys. After all, she has a small bedroom.

Small-Pet Facts
Hamsters can run five to six miles a night.

Gerbils make complicated burrow systems. They have tunnels and rooms.

Mice can learn tricks. They can come when they're called.

Mice love to climb.

Hamsters have 16 teeth.

Hamsters can smell something 60 feet away.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The United States has been fighting in Afghanistan for 14 years. It has been fighting the Taliban.

The Taliban used to run all of Afghanistan. They treated women very badly. They also killed many people.

In 2001 the United States forced the Taliban out of power. New Afghan leaders then took over.

Taliban Is Back
The Taliban never really left Afghanistan, though. They grew strong again over time. Now they are trying to take over the country a second time.

Two years ago President Barack Obama promised to end the war in Afghanistan. He said he would bring all U.S. troops home.

There are different kinds of U.S. troops in Iraq. Some are in the Army. Others fly planes.

Obama Said He Had To Change His Plans
On Thursday Obama said he will not be able to keep his promise. Things have just gotten too bad in Afghanistan. The troops will have to stay.

Next year the United States will keep almost 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. By 2017, there will still be 5,500 troops there.

Obama had promised to end the war next year. Now, the war will be handed over to whoever becomes president next. Obama will leave office early in 2017.

The president said he knows Americans are tired of the long war in Afghanistan. He said the fighting must go on a little longer.

U.S. Must Help Keep Taliban From Power
Afghans need more help from the United States, he said. Afghan troops have been trying to keep Taliban fighters from taking over their country again.

Obama said Afghan troops have been fighting well. The Taliban is still very strong, though. Without U.S. help, Afghan troops could lose the fight.

U.S. troops in Afghanistan will not only be fighting. They will also train Afghan troops.

Winning Back Captured City
Things have been getting worse in Afghanistan. Last month Taliban fighters took over the important city of Kunduz. Afghan troops won the city back with help from the United States It took a lot of hard fighting.

The U.S. cannot let the Taliban take over any more cities, Obama said. If the Taliban wins power again, much will be lost. The country could go back to the dark days before 2001.

This year, America's longest war could end. President Joe Biden plans to bring home soldiers from Afghanistan. It is a country in Central Asia. American soldiers have been in the country for 20 years. They invaded after the September 11, 2001, attacks against the United States.

The U.S. is pushing for a treaty between the Afghan government and the Taliban. The Taliban is a violent extremist group. It ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. Since then, it has been fighting the Afghan government.

Biden has a May 1 deadline. This was agreed to by former President Donald Trump. He must bring home all U.S. troops, but this may be difficult.

Peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban have stopped. Recently, Turkey said that it would bring both sides together. They will meet in Istanbul. This is Turkey's capital.

Here are key questions and answers about the conflict.

Why Is The United States In Afghanistan?
In 2001, the United States declared war on Afghanistan. The U.S. was angry Osama bin Laden was allowed to live in Afghanistan. The U.S. believes bin Laden planned the September 11, 2001, attacks.

The U.S. drove the Taliban from power in 2001. They did it with the help of local Afghan forces. The local forces were against the Taliban.

However, the group still had support. It slowly returned to strength and seized land.

The Taliban now controls over half of Afghanistan.

Many Afghans fear the Taliban will return to power. The Taliban was harsh. It made everyone follow very strict rules and laws.

What Is At Stake As Withdrawal Looms?
The Taliban has gained power. U.S. officials want to keep soldiers in Afghanistan. They worry that militants could again launch attacks against the U.S.

The Taliban has gained a lot of territory. Most American leaders agree that the war has gone on too long. Too many people have been killed. However, leaving too quickly could do more harm than good.

Afghan civilians don't want the U.S. soldiers to leave. They will be left at the mercy of the Taliban.

How Many U.S. Troops Are In The country?
There are 2,500 soldiers in Afghanistan. That's the lowest number since 2001.

What Is The Situation On The Ground?
The number of attacks have increased. More than 3,000 civilians were killed last year.

The Taliban continue to target civilians. At least 11 journalists and media workers were killed last year.

In recent years, other armed groups have formed. They have attacked civilians.

What Is The Status Of The Peace Talks Between The Taliban And Afghanistan's Government?
Peace talks began last September.

The talks in Turkey may restart the process. However, Afghanistan's politicians are divided.

Some warn that the Taliban could gain more power. It would gain more in upcoming talks. Civilians do not want the Taliban to share power with the Afghan government. The country could wind up with the Taliban in control. It would mean a return to its strict rule.

The community football season started in April 2021. Girls and women once again took to the field.

In 2016, there were 380,000 female football players across Australia. There are now 600,000 female players.

Moonee Valley Football Club is in Victoria. It has 30 new junior players this year. There's also an extra junior and senior team. The club began in 2016 with 17 female players. Today it has more than 170.

Jemma Moschini has joined the Mooney Valley club. Jemma is 13 years old. She had tried her hand at dance like her sisters. However, she said she felt "stronger" on the field. She wanted to play "a bit more rough".

"Football, it makes me who I am," Jemma said. "I think it's a sport everyone should be able to enjoy."

'If You Have A Close-Knit Group, It Shows On The Field'
Hannah Greasley works at Moonee Valley. She said the club's strength was its culture. Senior players go to junior training sessions. They help the younger players get better at football. "If you have a close-knit group, it shows on the field," she said.

Audrey Brown plays in the Under 14s team. She spent lockdown kicking the footy. "I just missed it because of the friendliness of the sport and getting to know the people," Audrey says.

Audrey trains with her mother, Sarah Gooden. She is a player in the club's seniors. "To be involved with Audrey and her team means the world to me," Gooden said.

Growing up, girls played netball and boys played footy, Gooden said. "The opportunity is now amazing."

Jadon Sancho of Borussia Dortmund celebrates scoring his team's second goal of the game with a "Justice for George Floyd" shirt during the German Bundesliga soccer match between SC Paderborn 07 and Borussia Dortmund at Benteler Arena in Paderborn, Germany, May 31, 2020. Athletes who make political or social justice protests at the Tokyo Olympics were promised legal support on April 22, 2021, by a global union and an activist group in Germany. The day before, the International Olympic Committee confirmed its ban on “demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda” on the field of play, medal podiums or official ceremonies.

The Olympic Games will begin in Tokyo, Japan, on July 23. Athletes from all over the world will compete. Some of those athletes might protest at the games. Protests are against Olympic rules. They are not allowed. Some athlete groups, however, support athletes who protest.

Why do athletes protest? Some countries treat people unfairly. They limit what some people can do. People might be harmed because of their race.

Some countries outlaw religions. Many athletes, however, want to help. They would like people who watch them compete to understand the suffering of others. They want to help to make change possible. So, they protest.

Athletes might protest by kneeling during a ceremony. They might hold up signs like "Black Lives Matter." Or they might hold up their fists.

Protesting Athletes Will Not Be Alone
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is in charge of the Olympics. It has rules controlling how the games run. Rule 50 forbids protests. The IOC warned athletes on April 22 not to break Rule 50. They will be punished if they do.

Not everyone agrees with these rules, though. Several international athlete groups support protesting athletes.

The World Players Association is one. This is a group of thousands of athletes. They are from all over the world. If athletes protest at the Olympics, the World Players Association promised it will support them.

In Germany, another group of athletes announced the same thing. German athletes who get in trouble for protesting will have this group's support.

Things Were Different In Mexico City
Many people remember the 1968 Olympics. Those games were held in Mexico City. An important protest happened there. Two Black American runners won the gold and bronze medals. Their names were Tommie Smith and John Carlos. At the medals ceremony, they raised their fists. They protested how the United States was treating Black people. The two athletes were thrown out of the Olympics.

But times have changed. In 2019, the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) honored these two athletes. They were celebrated as heroes.

The head of the USOPC is Sarah Hirschland. She said the USOPC will not punish U.S. athletes who protest at the Olympic trials. It supports athletes speaking out for justice. The USOPC does not agree with the International Olympic Committee. It does not support Rule 50.

The president of World Athletics backs athlete protests, too. His name is Sebastian Coe. Last December he gave an award to Smith and Carlos.

Ramadan is an important month for Muslims. It is special to Islam.  Muslims follow Islam. It is one of the world's main religions.

Ramadan is at a different time each year. It always lasts for 30 days. In 2021, Ramadan began on April 12. It will last until May 12.

During Ramadan, Muslims pray more than usual. They try to be good. They fast from sunrise to sunset. Fasting means they do not eat or drink.

Ramadan is about family and friends. When the sun sets, people come together to break their fast. They share a meal called "iftar".

Aylin Altinors cooks for her family during Ramadan. She is married to  Cengiz Altinors. Mrs Altinors makes sure there are many dishes. "You look at your dinner table and think: Is this going to be enough?" she says.

Ramadan was different in 2020. The outbreak of COVID-19 kept people apart. COVID-19 is a flu like illness. It has been spreading across the world. Australians had to stay at home to help stop the spread of germs. Visiting friends and family was not allowed. Evening prayers were held online.

After Pandemic Year, Normalcy Starts To Return
This year, the Altinors can have guests again. Spending time with others is an important part of Ramadan. Mr Altinors is looking forward to iftar with his parents. They live next door.

Ramadan ends with a holiday called Eid al-Fitr. It sounds like "Ee-d ul Fit-ar". It lasts for three days. During Eid, families feast together. They also give gifts.

The Altinors said Eid is a fun time for their children. They will visit older Muslims. They drink tea and eat sweets.

How a vet hospital on wheels rescued Australian wildlife during floods

In March 2021, there were days of heavy rain. A huge flood swept through New South Wales (NSW). Thousands of animals lost their homes. Many more were injured.

Evan Quartermain works for Humane Society International. It is an animal protection group. Quartermain said floods cause problems for wildlife.

Wombats and echidnas live in the ground. Echidnas are sometimes called spiny anteaters. They can be trapped by floodwaters, he said. Platypus and turtles live in the water. They "can easily be swept far from their territories."

The wild weather also creates trouble for birds. Their nests can be blown from trees in the rain.

Australia's Largest Moving Wildlife Hospital
Expert veterinarians are helping the injured wildlife. Veterinarians, or vets for short, are animal doctors. They have been treating the wildlife at an animal hospital. However, this hospital is not in a building. It's in a 22-wheel semi-trailer.

A small bat is wrapped in a towel. It is held in a black-gloved hand.

The trailer is 18 metres long. That's about the length of a cricket pitch. It is Australia's largest moving wildlife hospital. It's also self-sufficient, which means it has everything it needs. It's filled with the best medical equipment and medicine.

Bree Talbot is the head vet at the animal hospital. She travelled to Cape Byron after the March floods. Cape Byron is a town in New South Wales. She saw a lot of animals with injuries.

Free Treatment For Animals
"During a disaster like floods or bushfires, demand for services like ours is great," Talbot said. However, the hospital needs more money. It is expensive to run.

The animal hospital opened in October 2020. It has provided free treatment for more than 500 animals. The 2021 flood will increase that count.

Byron Bay Wildlife Hospital has asked people to be careful. It says people need to look out for injured wildlife. It also warns people to "never drive through floodwater". Driving through floodwater is very dangerous. It could mean another rescue.

Biocrusts are an entire world beneath our feet

Scientists found a sample of very old soil, or dirt, about 20 years ago. It contained what looked like "mats" of microbial life. Microbial life, or microbes, is made up of very small living things, such as bacteria and viruses. It showed that life on land could be a billion years older than they previously thought. (A billion is a thousand million.)

The scientists might have found an early biological crust, or "biocrust." These are patches of life and soil. They are important to healthy ecosystems. An ecosystem is a biological community made up of plants, animals and microorganisms.

In March, scientists published a new study. It shows just how different biocrusts can be. The study was led by Náthali Machado de Lima. She is a microbiologist at the University of New South Wales in Australia. Microbiologists are scientists who study microbes. She describes biocrusts as interwoven communities.

What's In A Biocrust?
Along with bacteria, biocrusts are home to many different living things. Algae, mosses and lichen can all be part of a biocrust. Algae are organisms with a single cell that are similar to plants that grow in water and depend on sunlight to make their food. Mosses are small plants that live in moist areas like forest floors. Lichens are unique organisms made up of a partnership between fungi and algae. There's even very small insects, microarthropods, that live in biocrusts.

"Crust" is a good word for biocrusts. That's exactly what they look and sound like, says Machado de Lima. They make up the top layer of the soil. If you walk on them, they might crunch, or break, under your feet.

Biocrusts make up about 12 percent of the Earth's land surface. They were around before plants like grasses, trees and ferns. And they do important work for the environment. They keep the soil from washing away, hold water and move nutrients through the environment.

Biocrusts In Different Biomes
Brazil has many different biomes, with different climates and rainfall amounts.  Machado de Lima and her team studied biocrusts in two different biomes in Brazil. A biome is an area that is classified based on what lives there. Light, soil, temperature and water affect what living things are in a biome.

A close up photo of a cactus growing in a rocky substrate.Zoom-in

One of the two biomes is the caatinga. It is a dry area in northeast Brazil. It is at risk of changing into a desert. The second biome is pampa. It is found in southern Brazil and is known for its grasslands. It is also at risk because of people using the land for farming and ranching.

Cyanobacteria In Biocrusts
Cyanobacteria are often the first organisms to form a biocrust, says Machado de Lima. Cyanobacteria are sometimes called "blue-green algae." These are tiny organisms made of single cells that live in all types of water. They use sunlight to make their own food. Certain kinds of cyanobacteria are stringy or beaded. They become entangled with soil particles. This forms a welcome setting for other creatures.

The scientists found the different biomes had a different mix of organisms. Caatinga sites had more of one type of cyanobacteria. It makes a material to protect itself from the sun. "We also found differences inside the same biome, among the sites," Machada de Lima says.

The study shows that there is a lot of difference within those ecosystems. For example, most research studies focus on biocrusts in the desert. Learning about all the different combinations of organisms in different biomes could help people protect them.

Machado de Lima thinks this information can help. It gives people ways to repair biocrusts. Scientists can use the right cyanobacteria an area needs. For example, cyanobacteria from a desert in the United States might not cut it in caatinga.

Biocrusts: Beautiful But Vulnerable
Biocrusts could decline by 25 to 40 percent in the next several decades. Humans can impact biocrusts by harming them. For example, anything from farming to hiking can hurt biocrusts. In parks in the American Southwest, there are signs warning hikers not to walk off the trail that read: "Don't bust the crust."

If you find yourself in a place that might have biocrust, stick to the trail and watch your step.

After sad Mother's Day 2020, vaccines offer sweet reunions this year

Leland Stein is going to see his mom on Mother's Day. He is bringing flowers and a year's worth of hugs.

"I miss Leland's visits very much," said Sondra Green, his mother. She is 93.

Many moms, grandmothers, and their offspring around the United States will be equally thrilled on Mother's Day. They were forced to stay apart on this special day last year.

This was because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health officials told people to be socially distant from one another. This means staying 6 feet away from others in public spaces. It also means not gathering in crowds. Health officials said doing this would help to limit the spread of COVID-19.

In-Person Hugs And Kisses Are On The Way
People who are elderly had to be more careful. So did people with health conditions. They were at higher risk of getting severe cases of COVID-19. This is why many people stayed away or only saw their older relatives and friends at a distance for the last year.

Now, 4 out 10 Americans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Getting the vaccine decreases the chances of getting COVID-19. It also is less likely someone will pass it on to other people.

Getting a COVID-19 vaccine has made people feel more comfortable. They feel OK visiting loved ones again. So they are bringing hugs and kisses for sweet in-person reunions.

Of course, not everyone will feel that joy. Some people lost family members in the last year. Some people lost their mothers. Some mothers lost a child. Other families are not socializing in person until they can all get vaccinated.

"It's Been Really Hard"
Heather Krug is 49 years old. She lives in Los Angeles, California. She has not seen her mother in a year and a half. Brenda Krug lives on the other side of the country in New York. She is 81.

"She has been pretty much without family throughout this," Heather Krug said. She explained that she had not felt comfortable flying during the pandemic. She did not want to bring COVID to her mother. With a vaccination, however, she feels better about the trip.

Maricela Waugh is in her 30s and lives in Los Angeles. She has a huge Mother's Day surprise for her mom, Marta.

Waugh's mother has wanted a grandchild for years, and she is about to get her wish. Waugh is pregnant.

"It's the ultimate gift," Waugh said. "We're extremely close. I tell my mother everything and it's been really hard because I don't really know what to do.'"

The two have not seen each other in person for a year.

Making Up For Missed Holidays
For months, the pandemic kept Janice Shear from her daughter, Meredith. She lives just 15 miles away in a group home.

Meredith has Down syndrome. It is a genetic condition. Chromosomes make up the genes that determine everything from your hair color to your height. Babies are born with 46 chromosomes. You get 23 from each parent. Babies with Down syndrome are born with 47 chromosomes. It changes the way they grow and develop. People with Down syndrome might have different physical features. They might also have delays in learning development.

Meredith's 40th birthday party was canceled last March. The group home stopped allowing visitors during the pandemic. Janice Shear had to make drive-by visits. She waved from her car. That was hard.

Now, both are vaccinated. Other family members are as well. They plan a Mother's Day barbecue together.

Mother's Day came early for Vanessa Gordon. She lives in Sag Harbor, New York. She is a mom of a 3-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter.

Vanessa and her husband have been vaccinated. So have her 87-year-old grandmother and an aunt. Gordon decided on a trip for everyone to see each other in Orlando, Florida. She combined her husband's birthday, Mother's Day and Easter.

"I was thrilled," Gordon said.

Referees work in many sports. They make sure players follow the rules.

A referee makes calls during a game. A call is a decision. They decide where a ball landed. They decide if a player broke a rule.

Sometimes a referee makes the wrong call. Maybe they miss where a ball landed. Maybe they do not see someone break a rule. Could computers do a better job?

Most sports already use special cameras. Referees use them to watch plays again. It helps them make the right call.

Robots Are Refereeing Tennis And Baseball
Some sports do even more. They use computers instead of a human referee.

Tennis does this. A game of tennis is called a match. In some matches, a computer watches the ball. It decides if the ball lands inside or outside of the lines.

Baseball also does this. A referee in baseball is called an umpire. In some games, the umpire uses a computer. It watches each pitch come in. Then it tells if the pitch was a ball or a strike.

These computers are sometimes called robots. Other sports could use them. Should robots take over for people?

Fewer Jobs And Fewer Human Mistakes
Robots make sports fair. A robot does not get tired. It does not like some teams or players more than others.

There are some problems. There would be fewer jobs for human referees.

Plus, mistakes can make people upset. That can make sports more interesting.

What do you think? Do you want robot referees in your favorite sport?

Our world is full of plastic. There are plastic bottles. There are plastic bags. Even our clothes are made of plastic. Fabrics like polyester are made from thin plastic fibers. Since plastics are everywhere, it means microplastics are everywhere.

Microplastics are small pieces of plastic. They are less than 5 millimeters (0.2 inches) long. They form when plastic objects start to slowly break down. Microplastic pollution is in the ocean. It is in the air.

Now, it even reached the peak of Mount Everest. Scientists reported their work in November 2020.

The Snow On Mount Everest Contains Plastics
Mount Everest is Earth's highest mountain. It is a very remote place. It is difficult to access. Once, it was clean and the snow was pure. But today, it has a nickname as the "world's highest junkyard." Tourists and climbers have left their trash behind.

Imogen Napper is a scientist. She works at the University of Plymouth in England. Napper tested snow collected from Everest. There were microplastics in every portion she tested.

Napper was shocked! How could the tiny plastics reach so high? Mount Everest is 8,850 meters tall. That is about 29,035 feet. Think of how big the Empire State Building is. Now think of 20 stacked on top of each other. That's about the height of Mount Everest.

Studying The Impact of Microplastic Pollution
Microplastics are harmful to the environment. They're very small. This makes them difficult to clean up. They are also small enough that some animals can easily eat them.

It is important to know where the microplastic comes from. Napper thinks most of the plastic comes from the clothing. Fabrics break down as people climb the mountain.  Some of it could come from somewhere else. Everest also has strong winds. Microplastics are light. The wind could carry them up the mountain. The wind can carry them from further away.

Napper's worried about all the microplastics in the environment. Microplastics have been found deep in the ocean. And now they're on the highest mountain on Earth. "These are the highest microplastics discovered so far," says Napper.

She says it is time to fix this problem. "We need to protect and care for our planet," she says.

Scientist and farmers team up to help Mexico’s biggest bears

Diana Zendejo is a scientist. Her research focuses on protecting bears. Zendejo also wants to help people get along with them. To do this, she is learning from people who live near the bears.

Zendejo is a student at the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon. It is in Mexico. There, she studies ecological restoration. This is a science that focuses on recovering damaged or destroyed environments.

Now, she works in northern Mexico, in an area where many farmers raise cows. But this area is also home to the biggest group of Mexico's largest bear: the black bear.

The people who live near these animals often know a lot about them. But for years, Zendejo says, scientists ignored their human neighbors. So, she wants to work with these local communities. By copying how people get along with black bears, we can help other farmers, too, Zendejo says.

Farming, Nature, And Conflict
Zendejo learned to love wildlife at a young age. She grew up in southern Mexico. Her family and friends told her stories about animals. "They were my first professors and inspiration," she said.

At college, Zendejo was able to connect with other bear scientists. Today, she works in Coahuila. It is a state in northeast Mexico. She explained that there are two main reasons for the conflicts between bears and people in the area: food and water.

Every year, bears hibernate. This is a process where an animal passes the winter in a resting state. They spend most of this time sleeping. It helps them save energy. But before hibernating, black bears build up fat by eating lots of food.

Human food is an easy way to fill up. The hungry bears eat human garbage. They sometimes eat food from farms. Zendejo says they see this food like "a kid sees a candy store."

These bears also live in dry areas. Some animals get water from their food. But, just like humans, bears need to drink water directly. In dry seasons, bears move into cities to find water.

In the future, climate change may cause stronger dry seasons in this area. Climate change is the significant change in the climate of Earth. It happens over a long period of time. Climate change could make life harder for black bears. It could cause more problems between bears and people.

Living With Bears
Now Zendejo is living her "bear-dream." She started a project called "Walking With Bears." She is working with an anthropologist. This is a scientist who studies human beings. Together, they are talking to farmers who live near bears. These people can teach others about being good neighbors to black bears.

Her other work involves taking photos. Her pictures show how scientists work to save animals. They show how people are trying to live with bears.

Zendejo hopes her work will help make life better for Mexico's black bears. It can also help people. Different types of scientists can learn from each other during this process.

Crested rats can kill with their poisonous fur

African crested rats are fuzzy and cute. But do not let their adorable faces fool you. Their fur is packed with a powerful poison. These are substances that cause harm to living things. The poison is so deadly that just a tiny amount can kill.

History Of Crested Rats
The rats are about the size of rabbits and live in woodlands in eastern Africa. They were first described in 1867. Scientists suspected they were poisonous. But it was hard to figure out where the poison came from. Crested rats are difficult to catch and observe.

In November 2020, scientists reported new observations of the rats' behavior in a scientific journal. They caught 25 crested rats in Kenya. They put cameras in the animals' pens. Then, they looked at nearly 1,000 hours of footage. The scientists found that the rats don't make the poison themselves. Instead, they get it from a plant called poison arrow trees. The trees contain chemicals that are very dangerous for most animals.

Crested rats first chew pieces of the tree bark to mix it with their saliva. Then, they brush the spit mixture onto hairs along their sides. It acts as a defense against predators that attack by biting. This includes animals such as hyenas, jackals and leopards. These animals bite crested rats where the poison is, causing them to die.

The rats don't seem to get sick from the poison. This could be because of their unusual stomachs. They contain a lot of different bacteria. Some of the bacteria may break up the poison and keep the rats from getting sick.

New Information About Crested Rats
Looking at the footage, the scientists made more discoveries. They used to think that the rats lived alone. So, they were surprised to learn that the rats lived in bonded male-female pairs. The rats spent more than half of their time together and communicated with sounds that included squeaks and purrs.

The crested rat is rarely seen in the wild. So scientists aren't sure of their population numbers. They're also unsure about their risk of extinction or dying out. More humans have been invading and changing the rats' habitat, or the natural environment where they live. So, risks to the animals have grown over the past ten years.

"We are looking at a broad range of questions influenced by habitat change," says Bernard Agwanda. He is the curator of mammals at the Museums of Kenya. He also worked on the research. "We need to understand how that impacts their survival."
