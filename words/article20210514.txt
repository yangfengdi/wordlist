The bugs are coming! Every 17 years, cicada bugs wake up from their long underground rest. These bugs come out to make their babies and make a lot of noise. This summer, the next group to come out will be one of the largest yet. It's called Brood X.

The bugs have been waiting underground since 2004. In late May and early June, the adults will appear in 15 states. Then, they'll spend two to four weeks flying around and annoying people.

Here's everything you need to know:

What Are Cicadas?

Cicadas are flying bugs. They are about 2.5 to 5 centimeters (1 to 2 inches) long. They are known for being very noisy. The males buzz loudly to talk to females and claim the area where they live. Cicadas can buzz between 80 and 100 decibels. This is about as loud as a low flying airplane or a lawn mower.

There are two different types of cicadas: annual and periodical. Annual cicadas are seen every year. They live for about 2 to 5 years. Periodical cicadas are seen every 13 to 17 years.

Image 2. Cicadas spend most of their time as nymphs living underground. They are only in their iconic adult stage for a few weeks. Graphic: Newsela staff
Adult periodical cicadas lay their eggs high up in trees. Four to six weeks later, the eggs hatch. The young, wingless cicadas that come out are known as nymphs.

The nymphs fall to the ground. They burrow into the soil to drink tree root sap. They stay there for 13 to 17 years until they surface as adults.

What Is A Brood?

Periodical cicadas emerge in huge groups. These are broods. Twelve of the broods come out every seven years. Three broods appear every 13 years. Almost every year somewhere in the country, a periodical brood will appear.

Why Is It Called Brood X?

Broods are named using Roman numerals, and "X" stands for 10. Brood X is just the 10th brood experts have followed.

What's Special About Brood X?

Brood X is one of the largest periodical cicada groups. It's also found across more states than any other brood. They are found from northern Georgia to New York. They're also as far west as the Mississippi River and in the Midwest.

There are as many as 1.5 million cicadas per acre. That is an area a little smaller than a football field. Added up, the whole brood has trillions of bugs.

Why Do They Emerge Every 17 Years?

Why cicadas stay underground so long is a big mystery. One reason could be that they have to spend a longer time growing. Cicadas are large bugs. But the sap they drink as food doesn't have many of the nutrients they need to grow. So the bugs need more time to eat enough to grow.

Image 3. Where will the cicadas emerge? Likely in these states above. Graphic: Newsela staff
Being larger could allow them to lay more eggs and create more babies. Many cicadas can then come out at the same time. Even if animals eat lots of them, there are still many left. This lets them keep the brood going.

Are Cicadas Dangerous?

Cicadas won't harm people. Just don't let pets eat too many of them.

Cicadas shouldn't affect grown trees. But young trees could be hurt by the eggs. Planting young trees should wait until the fall.

Gardeners can also protect young trees with a net. People should not use chemicals like pesticides. These are substances used to kill, keep away, or control certain forms of plant or animal life that are pests. Many of them don't work on cicadas. They could also hurt other bugs.

President Joe Biden was where he wanted to be on April 30.

Biden was at Amtrak's train station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He helped Amtrak workers enjoy an important moment. Amtrak was marking 50 years of service.

"I wouldn't have missed this for the world," Biden said. He calls Amtrak workers his "family." Biden has been riding Amtrak trains for almost 50 years.

Biden's Infrastructure Plan

Biden used the event to let people know more about his infrastructure plan. Infrastructure is those things people rely on in their daily lives. It includes railways, roads, bridges and drinking water.

Biden's plan looks to make America's infrastructure better. It will also create jobs. To make his plan happen, the U.S. Congress must pass it into law. Biden's new plan will cost $2.3 trillion.

One part of the plan would put $621 billion toward transportation. Workers would make roads, bridges and train systems better. Travel would be easier.

Amtrak would get $80 billion. Its workers could make repairs. Amtrak could also offer better service in the Northeast. Biden said the Northeast is key for America. Many important companies are there.

Biden's plan would help Amtrak to grow, too. The train company plans to add 30 new routes in the U.S. It would add more trains as well. More people could travel by train.

A Long History With Amtrak

Biden has been riding Amtrak nearly from the start. The company began in May 1971.

In 1972, Biden's family was in a car crash. His wife and daughter died. His young sons were also badly hurt.

Biden had just won a spot as a U.S. senator. He thought about not taking the job. Finally, he did. Yet he decided to go home every night. He wanted to be with his sons.

Biden lived in Wilmington, Delaware. He took the train to work in Washington, D.C. It takes about an hour-and-a-half to get there. Biden took Amtrak home, too. Biden rode Amtrak almost every day for 36 years.

Bill Flynn heads Amtrak. Flynn said Biden knew almost everybody at the Wilmington train station.

Biden said he held Christmas parties for Amtrak employees. He attended weddings. He even went to funerals.

In 2011, Amtrak renamed its Wilmington station. It is now named the Joseph Biden Jr. Railroad Station.

How the 2020 census shifted House seats and could affect 2022 midterm elections
SavedRead AloudShare

An image.
Image 1. Based on the results of the 2020 census, seven states will lose seats in the House of Representatives and six states will gain seats. Each orange circle represents a single seat lost. Each green circle represents a single seat gained. Graphic: USA Today
By USA Today, adapted by Newsela staff
Published:05/11/2021
Word Count:703
Every 10 years, the United States counts its population. The survey is done by the U.S. Census Bureau. The latest census was in 2020. The results will change the makeup of the House of Representatives.

The House of Representatives has 435 seats. Each state is represented by a number of these seats. The number is determined by the state's population. Based on the census data, the number of seats for each state may change. States that gained more people may get more seats. These seats will be moved over from states where the population shrunk.

That happened this year. Texas gained two seats. Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon all gained one seat each. Seven states each lost a seat. These states are California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

Many of the states that gained seats mostly vote Republican. The seats will be moved from states that mostly vote Democrat.

This may affect the 2022 midterm elections.

A graphic showing that Democrats hold 218 seats in the House of Representatives and Republicans hold 212 seats.
Image 2. Based on the results of the 2020 election, Democrats (represented by the blue dots) hold more seats in the House of Representatives compared to Republicans (represented by the red dots). Graphic: USA Today
House's Balance Of Power Is Tipped Toward Democrats

The Democrats currently control the House of Representatives. This means they have more seats. This majority is narrow. They have just six more seats than Republicans. They will soon have seven. A Democrat is filling a seat for Louisiana. Democrats may not be able to hold on to this advantage.

Republicans could take control of the House. They just need to win a handful of seats.

A graphic.
Image 3. This map shows the number of House members each state has and which states gained or lost House members based on the results of the 2020 census. Graphic: USA Today
Which States Would Gain Or Lose House Members?

The states that gained seats mostly vote Republican. Texas, Florida, Montana and North Carolina all voted for the previous president, Donald Trump, in the 2020 presidential election. North Carolina was a close race. Trump narrowly defeated President Biden. Oregon and Colorado voted strongly Democratic in the last election.

States that lost seats mostly vote Democratic. California, Illinois and New York voted strongly for Biden. Biden narrowly won in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Trump won in Ohio and West Virginia.

Number Of People Each House Member Represents Will Change

The number of people in each district will mostly grow in 2022. In some states, it will decrease.

Montana gained a representative. Each one will now represent the smallest number of people.

Delaware has one House representative. That seat will represent the largest number of people.

Who Controls Redrawing District Maps?

Thirteen states were affected by the results of the 2020 census. They each must redraw their districts.

Voters are grouped into districts. Their district depends on where they live. The boundaries of these districts should make it so that each district has about the same number of voters. The voters should also be representative of the larger area. This is not always the case, however. Gerrymandering is when district lines are redrawn to favor one party over the other. They also can be redrawn to reduce the power of votes from communities of color.

Michael Li works for a law organization. He said all this new redistricting could lead to more gerrymandering.

In some states, the process is fairer than others, he said. For example, there might be a redistricting committee that is not tied to a specific political party. Michigan does this. In other states, though, the party in power controls the process.

How Did State Populations Change From 2010 To 2020?

The U.S. population has increased by 7.4 percent. The total population is 331,449,281 people.

California has the biggest population with 39,538,223 people. Wyoming has the smallest, with 576,851 people.

Utah reported the fastest-growing population. It increased by 18.4 percent. West Virginia's population decreased the most. It dipped 3.2 percent.

Scientists may have finally found how catnip repels insects

Want mosquitoes to "buzz off?" Try growing some catnip. This plant makes cats playful. But it makes mosquitos fly away. Now scientists know why.

Catnip is a plant related to mint. It is good at keeping bugs away. Scientists found it could work as well as some bug sprays. But they wanted to find out how catnip makes bugs leave.

Scientists Test Catnip

Scientists did some tests to find out. They put mosquitoes and fruit flies in a petri dish. This is a round dish. Scientists use it to grow things. They added catnip to the dish. Fruit flies did not lay as many eggs around catnip.

Mosquitoes also did not like catnip. The scientists put the catnip on a human hand. The mosquitoes did not want to bite the hand.

But why did the bugs not like this plant? To find out, scientists tested some special bugs. These insects did not have the same sensor as other bugs. Sensors sense chemicals and substances. Then, they tell the body how to react.

The special bugs did not mind catnip. Without the sensor, catnip does not hurt the insects. Scientists found that the sensor tells bugs to stay away from the plant. It causes the bugs to feel pain. They can also feel itchiness.

Grow Your Own Bug Repellant

What the scientists found could help people. Mosquitoes can give people diseases. Scientists want to study the oil the plant makes. They could use it to make better bug sprays.

Other animals are not annoyed by the plant. It makes cats happy. Even humans are safe from the plant. That makes catnip a good bug repellent. It keeps bugs away without hurting other animals.

Plus, you can grow it in your backyard. But plant catnip in a pot: in the garden, it can spread like a weed.

George Takei on his childhood in internment camps — and his faith in the future

George Takei is a Japanese American actor. Many people know him for appearing in the show "Star Trek." These days, he wants people to understand another important part of his life. He was a child during World War II.

In World War II, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor is a military base in Hawaii. The United States then entered World War II. At home, the government targeted Japanese Americans. Approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans were relocated. Thousands were forced to leave their homes. The government moved these families to camps.

Takei is determined to keep talking about his story. He wants people to know what happened. He hopes people will fight similar injustices today.

Takei was 5 years old when his family left their home. Takei's father said they were going on vacation. Years later, Takei would realize it was not a vacation.

Childhood In The Camps

Takei's family was sent to camps in Arkansas and Northern California. They spent four years in the camps. As an adult, Takei wrote about his experiences in a graphic memoir. This is a picture-based book about someone's life. His memoir is titled "They Called Us Enemy."

Takei said his experience at the camp shaped his life. It also shaped his career. Takei's father had a strong influence on him. "My father said, 'You have to actively participate.' It was the camps and my father's good guidance that made me the activist that I am."

Fighting For Justice

Takei agrees with his father: participation is important. He hopes more people will vote in upcoming elections.

Takei is active on social media. He has almost 3 million followers on Twitter. He uses Twitter to speak out for important issues.

Being visible in popular culture is important to Takei. During World War II, the media portrayed Japanese Americans in a bad way. Takei says these stereotypes created unfair ideas about Japanese Americans. Stereotypes are untrue representations of a group of people. They were part of the reason why people were put in camps.

Takei played Mr. Sulu on "Star Trek." This role was historic. "Star Trek" premiered in 1966. It was the first time a Japanese American actor was in a lead role on TV.

Faith In The Future

Craig Nakano is an arts and culture editor at the Los Angeles Times. His parents were also sent to the camps during World War II. Nakano appreciates Takei's memoir "They Called Us Enemy." Some scenes reflected his own parents' stories.

Nakano's father saved a yearbook from 1945. The yearbook had images of people living in the camps. The high school principal wrote a letter to the students as camps closed. It said: "Let us have faith in the future. Let us not exaggerate our fears and difficulties."

Takei said Nakano's yearbook reminded him of his own father. Takei's father used to say strength is not always muscle. Sometimes, strength is creating joy under tough circumstances.

Many Americans think fortune cookies are a Chinese food. But this is not true. Fortune cookies were created in the United States. In fact, it is believed they were first made by Japanese immigrants.

Chinese immigrants arrived in the United States during the 1850s. These immigrants wanted jobs. At the time, there was a demand for workers in mining, farming, and manual labor. However, this created competition for jobs. American men did not want Chinese workers. This pressure pushed Chinese workers to find other jobs.

Some of these immigrants created the first Chinese restaurants. They served Chinese food. However, they changed recipes for American tastes. Chop suey, for example, is a Chinese-style dish. Chop suey was a popular "Chinese" dish in the United States in the 1900s. Except, chop suey was not Chinese.

Writing Fortunes

The fortune cookie appeared in the United States around the 1920s. The cookie does not come from China. Still, it is a part of Chinese American culture. In fact, many cookies and their fortunes are made by Chinese Americans.

Steven Yang is the owner of Yang's Fortunes. His company prints the paper fortunes. The company has a list of 5,000 sayings to print. Boxes of fortunes are sent to cookie factories around the United States.

This is a black and white Japanese art print from 1878 showing Japanese people making fortune cookies.Zoom-in
Image 2. Japanese print from 1878. Japanese cooks are shown making fortune cookies during the Edo period. The Edo period of Japan lasted from 1603 to 1868. Photo: Museum of Food and Drink.
Japanese Origins

Fortune cookies came from Japan. Japanese art from the 1800s shows fortune cookies being made.

Jennifer Lee is a journalist and the author of the book "The Fortune Cookie Chronicles: Adventures in the World of Chinese Food." Lee interviewed Japanese Americans for research. One participant was Sally Osaki. Sally grew up in California during the 1930s. She remembered reading fortunes in Japanese as a child.

Jennifer took a trip to Kyoto, Japan. There, she found a larger and darker fortune cookie. It was not as sweet as American cookies. This is the ancestor of the American version. So, why do we get these Japanese fortune cookies at the end of Chinese meals?

A Transfer Of Cookies During War

Early Japanese immigrants in the United States owned Chinese restaurants. Here, they introduced the Japanese fortune cookie. They created the sweeter, American version.

Then, World War II changed many lives. Thousands of Japanese Americans were forced into government-run camps. This happened because Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. After the attack, the United States government targeted Japanese Americans. About 120,000 families were put in these internment camps.

The people in these camps lost their homes. Many left behind their businesses. During this time, Chinese Americans in California began making fortune cookies. After the war, Japanese Americans tried to return to their lives. But by then, fortune cookies were known as Chinese.

Today, the fortune cookie is eaten around the world. However, you still will not find fortune cookies in China.

Japan makes pretty sandwiches. The sandwiches are called furutsu sando. They are made with fruit and whipped cream. The fruit often looks like flowers.

They were first made in the 1800s. Now, you can buy them anywhere.

You might not be able to visit Japan. But, it's easy to make fruit sandwiches at home. Just follow the recipe below. It calls for oranges and kiwis. But you can use any fruit you want!

Flowery Fruit Sando

Ingredients

2 pieces of fluffy white bread

1 cup heavy whipping cream

2 tablespoons superfine sugar

1/2 teaspoons almond or vanilla extract

1 small mandarin orange

1 kiwi

Instructions

Peel the fruit. Stand the kiwi on end. Cut it two times. The two cuts should go top to bottom. They should be near the middle. One cut goes just to the left. The other cut goes just to the right. Be careful while cutting. Or, ask an adult to help you.

There will be two round kiwi pieces. These pieces look like flower leaves. There will also be a skinny middle piece. It looks like a flower stem.

Make the whipped cream. Get a dry, cold bowl. Pour the heavy cream in. Mix it with a mixer. It should be at a medium-low speed. The cream will become puffy. Stop mixing. Then, add the sugar and flavoring. Whip again on high. The whipped cream should be very thick. This will stop the sandwich from getting soggy.

Tear a large piece of plastic wrap. Lay a piece of bread on the wrap. Cover the bread with whipped cream. Place the orange in the cream. The orange should be on the upper part of the bread. Gently press it into the cream. It should stand up.

Take one piece of kiwi. Place it right under the orange. The cut side should face down. Cover the kiwi with cream. Take the skinny piece of kiwi. Place it on the cream. Cover it with more cream. Take the last piece of kiwi. Place it on the cream. The cut side should face up. Then cover the whole sandwich with cream. It should be a thick, even layer.

Take the other piece of bread. Lay it on top. The sandwich should be very tall. Wrap the sandwich with plastic wrap. Put it in the refrigerator for a few hours.

Now, it is time to eat. Ask an adult to help you cut the sandwich. Cut down the middle first. The sandwich should be cut into two rectangles. Clean the knife after each cut. Cut all the crusts. Open up the sandwich. You should have a pretty flower!

In Japan, fruit sandwiches are everywhere. They are called furutsu sando. Many have flowery patterns of fruit.

The sandwiches are made with sweet, fluffy bread. It is called shokupan.

These sweet sandwiches were first made in the 1800s. The Japanese government wanted to Westernize the country. This meant it adopted Western culture and ideas. This included sandwiches.

Follow the recipe below to make your own fruit sandwich. The recipe calls for oranges and kiwis. But you can use any fruit you want!

Flowery Fruit Sando

Makes one sandwich

Ingredients

2 slices shokupan, or any thick, fluffy white bread

1 cup heavy whipping cream

2 tablespoons superfine sugar

1/2 teaspoons almond or vanilla extract (optional)

1 small mandarin orange

1 kiwi

Instructions

Peel the fruit. Stand the kiwi on one end. Cut it twice from top to bottom, slightly to the left and right of the center. Make sure to be careful while using the knife. Or, ask an adult to help you. The result will be three kiwi slices. Two domes will be the flower's leaves. The skinny centerpiece will be the stem. Dry the kiwi with a paper towel.

Make the whipped cream. Put heavy cream into a chilled, dry bowl. Mix it with a mixer on medium-low speed. The cream will become puffy. Stop mixing and add the sugar and flavoring. Then whip again on high. The whipped cream should be thick. If not, the sandwich will lose shape and get soggy.

Cut a piece of plastic wrap. It should be large enough to wrap the tall sandwich. Lay one piece of shokupan in the center of the wrap. Cover it with a thick layer of whipped cream. Place the orange above the upper half of the bread. Gently press it into the whipped cream. It should stand upright. This creates the flowery look of the fruit.

Place one of the kiwi pieces directly below the orange. The cut side should face down. Cover the kiwi with another thick layer of whipped cream. Place the flat piece of kiwi on top. Cover with another layer of cream. Place another kiwi on it. The cut side should face up. Finally, cover everything with a thick layer of whipped cream.

Lay the other piece of shokupan on top. Softly press the sandwich. Wrap it tightly with the plastic wrap. Put the sandwich in the refrigerator for several hours.

When ready to eat, ask an adult for help with cutting the sandwich. Use a sharp knife. Softly press the sandwich. Cut down the middle first. This makes two rectangles. Then cut the crusts. Wipe the knife before each cut. Finally, open up the sandwich. There's a pretty flower!

A new study is looking at the number of fish near the equator. The equator is an imaginary line. It runs around the middle of the Earth, like a belt.

The study found that some species are moving away from the equator. A species is a group of similar living things. The group can mate and have babies. They moved away because the water has become too hot. Scientists say it was caused by global warming.

Global warming is the long-term heating of the Earth. It is caused by the burning of natural fuels. Natural fuels include oil and gas. Global warming is also called climate change. It can raise the temperature of the ocean. When water gets too warm, sea creatures can die.

David Schoeman co-wrote the study. He works at the University of the Sunshine Coast. It is in Queensland. The study looked at the migration of almost 50,000 sea species between 1955 and 2015. They included whales, jellyfish and corals.

Schoeman said species that live near the ocean floor were fine. It is cooler on the ocean floor. However, there were fewer types of fish closer to the surface. Schoeman found that the fish didn't disappear. "They've just gone from the tropics," he said.

Schoeman said that ocean heating was "becoming more intense." "We really need to be acting now," he said. "Climate change is with us."

Tropical Species Not Ready For Change

Dr. Jodie Rummer is a scientist from James Cook University. It is in Queensland. Tropical species have only three choices if the water keeps warming, she said. They could learn to live with it, they could move to a cooler part of the ocean or they could die.

Rummer said understanding ocean heating was important. Not only to protect sea creatures. Many people who live near the equator depend on fishing. Fish are key to the "survival of millions of people," she said. They will have no way to earn money if the fish disappear.

Muslims all over the world are celebrating Eid al-Fitr this week. It is one of the biggest religious holidays for Muslims.

1. What is Eid?

Eid literally means "festival" or "feast" in Arabic. There are two major Eids in the Islamic calendar per year. One is Eid al-Fitr. It comes earlier in the year. The other one is Eid al-Adha. It comes later in the year.

Eid al-Fitr is a three-day-long festival. It is known as the "Lesser" or "Smaller Eid." Eid al-Adha is a four-day-long festival. It is known as the "Greater Eid."

2. Why is Eid celebrated twice a year?

Each Eid celebrates something different. Each one has to do with a different event. These are major events in the Islamic faith.

Eid al-Fitr means "the feast of breaking the fast." This Eid marks the end of the holy fasting month, Ramadan. During this time Muslims fast from food and water from sunrise to sunset. This happens every day for one month. Muslims also try to increase their good deeds.

Ramadan marks an important time for Muslims. This is when Muslims believe that the Quran was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. The Quran is the holy book for Muslims.

3. How do Muslims celebrate Eid al-Fitr?

Eid al-Fitr features two to three days of celebrations. This includes special morning prayers. People greet each other with "Eid Mubarak." This means "Blessed Eid."

It is common to make special sweets for Eid. This Eid is considered especially fun for kids. It is tradition to give children gifts and money for Eid. Many communities also host carnivals for Eid.

In many countries with large Muslim populations, Eid al-Fitr is a national holiday. Schools, offices and businesses close down. That way family, friends and neighbors can enjoy the celebrations together. In the United States, Eid is not a national holiday. So Muslims may request the day off from school or work to celebrate.

4. How do Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha?

The other festival, Eid al-Adha, is the "feast of the sacrifice." It comes at the end of the Hajj. This is the annual trip by millions of Muslims to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. It is required for all Muslims to do once in their lifetime. It is not if you don't have the money for it. You also don't have to do it if your health is not good.

5. When are they celebrated?

Eid al-Fitr is celebrated on the first day of the 10th month in the Islamic calendar.

Eid al-Adha is celebrated on the 10th day of the final month in the Islamic calendar.

The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar. The dates are calculated based on lunar phases. The Islamic calendar year is shorter than the solar Gregorian calendar year by 10 to 12 days. So the dates for Ramadan and Eid on the Gregorian calendar change every year.

6. What is the spiritual meaning of Eid al-Fitr?

Eid al-Fitr is a time for charity. Eid is meant to be a time of joy and blessing for the entire Muslim community. It is also a time for distributing one's wealth.

Giving charity to those in need is an important value in Islam. The Quran says: "Believe in Allah and his messenger, and give charity out of the (substance) that Allah has made you heirs of. For those of you who believe and give charity – for them is a great reward."

Kristyn Leach is a Korean American farmer. She owns a small farm in California called Choi and Daughters. She grows special vegetables and greens. Her vegetables and herbs all come from Korea and East Asia.

Leach was born in South Korea. She was adopted by an Irish-Catholic family in New York. Her interest in gardening began as a child. As an adult, she began working on farms. Leach found work in Northern California. There, she met farmer Dennis Dierks.

Dierks and Leach developed a strong bond. They were both interested in Korean natural farming. It is a natural agricultural practice. Native microorganisms add nutrients to the soil. Microorganisms include bacteria and fungi. It is better for the soil than pesticides.

Many Asian Americans Have Farmed The Land

San Francisco has a large Asian American population. Since the mid-1800s, Asian Americans have been in Northern California. Throughout this history, they have farmed the land.

This is a photo of a green plant.

The Gold Rush began in California in 1848. It was a period where many people moved to California to mine gold. Many Chinese immigrants moved to Northern California. Soon, these immigrants began working on local farms.

In 1882, the United States passed the Chinese Exclusion Act. This made it hard for Chinese people to immigrate. Farmers from Japan, Korea and the Philippines arrived to San Francisco. They introduced their own farming practices. They also brought their own seeds.

A Seed Partnership Begins

The Kitazawa Seed Company began in 1917. It is America's oldest company that sells Asian vegetable seeds. Japanese American Gijiu Kitazawa started the business. Then, World War II began. Kitazawa had to close the shop for three years. The American government sent Japanese Americans into camps. This was in response to Japan's attack on an American military base in Hawaii. After the war, Kitazawa left the camp. He reopened his company. Seeds could be shipped again.

Leach first ordered Korean perilla from Kitazawa. Perilla is a leafy green herb with a sharp taste. This began a strong relationship. Leach started to create her own Korean seed varieties. She produced a batch of Korean chili pepper seeds for the company. The seeds were a success. She continues to add new seeds for Kitazawa to sell.

Leach's farming has introduced new foods to her area. She started sharing plants with local restaurants. This brought traditional and new flavors to kitchens.

Leach enjoys seeds that connect people with their history.

The Seeds Of Success

Leach has rare seeds. She also sells seeds that are important to Asian cultures. For example, the Lady Hermit pepper makes gochujang paste. This paste is common in Korean dishes.

Leach's farm was a huge success. But the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 created new challenges. Many local restaurants she worked with struggled to stay open.

Even so, Leach continued to sell seeds. She discovered that people still enjoyed gardening at home. Leach recognized that her work mattered. For her, environmentally friendly farming practices and seed preservation are key to the farm's success.
