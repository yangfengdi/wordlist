Thurgood's work helped make it possible for black, white, and Latino students to all say the Pledge of Allegiance together.
Finally, Thurgood Marshall argued his most important case of all. He argued that it was unfair to have separate schools for black children and white children. He argued that they should go to public school together. Thurgood won his case.

Who Serves on the Supreme Court?
The nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court gather for a photo in October 2010.
     For many years, only white men served on the Supreme Court. Of the nine justices, there were no women and no people of color. Because the president appoints each justice for life, it took a long time to make things more equal. The first change came when Thurgood Marshall became a justice in 1967. Then the first woman, Sandra Day O'Connor, was appointed in 1981. In 2013, one African American man and three women served on the court, including one Latina woman.
10
Even so, when Thurgood was a child, the South still had many laws that hurt black people. They were not allowed to eat in many restaurants that served white people.
Thurgood stands in front of the Supreme Court.
He argued many cases before the Supreme Court—the most important court in the United States. In the Supreme Court, the judges are called justices.

        Energy from the Earth
  Some places under the earth are very hot. They have layers of hot rock and hot water deep underground. Hot steam rises out of openings in the ground. The steam is trapped in pipes and used to spin the blades of a generator.

            Saving Energy
People use more energy each year. We use lots of coal, oil, and natural gas to run our cars, homes, and businesses. Our natural resources are limited. They can't last forever.
16
        Energy from Wind
Wind can be used to make electricity. Blowing wind turns the large blades of a wind generator. The generator uses energy from the spinning blades to make electricity.
12
Energy from Food Sources
You get energy from foods you eat. Animals you eat may get energy from the plants they eat. Plants use energy from the Sun to make their own food. Plants can store the food they make in roots, stems, and leaves.
6
        Energy from Gasoline
Most cars, trucks, planes, and trains get energy from gasoline. Gasoline is made from oil. Oil is a natural resource found deep underground. Wells pump oil up from the ground. Factories change the oil into gasoline.

Introduction
We use energy for many of the things we do every day. Energy lights, heats, and cools our homes and schools. It allows things to move around.
You need energy to run and play. You need energy to think and sleep. Where does this energy come from?

        How Police Officers Help People
     Police officers help people in many ways.
     They stop crime.
     They direct traffic.
     They stop speeders.
     In many countries, police officers get training at special schools.
     These schools are called police academies. Police officers learn things at the academy that help them do their job.
     They learn about laws.
     They learn how to control people.
     They learn about the safe use of weapons.
     And they learn how to treat injuries.

            Staying Safe
Model rockets are fun, but they can be dangerous. Follow these rules to stay safe:
•  Use only safe materials and engines in your rocket.
•  Always launch your rocket outside in an open area.
•  Make sure there is no dry grass or any other fire hazard at the launch site.
•  Make sure everyone is at least 15 feet (4.5 m) away before you launch your rocket.
•  Count down before you launch.
•  Ask an adult for help if you have any questions.

Clouds drop water on the desert as rain.
When water vapor in the air cools down, it changes from a gas to a liquid. This process is called condensation. Clouds are made up of tiny drops of water formed by condensation. The tiny drops stick together, creating larger, heavier drops. Once they're large enough, they fall to the ground as rain or another type of precipitation.

A statue of Balto was built in a city park. Balto and some of his teammates were in a dog show. They were not treated well and were kept in small cages. People gave money to bring the dogs to Cleveland, Ohio. They stayed in a zoo for the rest of their lives.
Balto is famous for his bravery. However, every sled dog on that journey helped save the sick children when there was little hope left.

Balto led the team through the storm. At one point, a gust of wind flipped the sled over. The medicine fell in a snowbank. Balto's musher dug it out with frozen hands.

The medicine could be delivered part of the way by train. Even so, it was 674 miles (1,085 km) from the last train stop to Nome.
Sled dogs were the best way to deliver the medicine through the snow. However, the distance was too far for one team. A sled dog relay was the only hope.

            The Great Sled Dog Relay
More than 20 teams and 150 dogs were to take part in the relay. Each musher would give the medicine to the next team along the way.
When the medicine arrived by train, it was handed to the first team, and the race was on.
A journey from the last train stop in Nenana to Nome would normally take twenty-five days by sled. The teams raced against time to deliver the medicine.

Who Was Abigail Adams?
Abigail Adams lived from 1744 to 1818. At that time, women mostly thought about their husbands, children, and home. Abigail Adams was different. She helped shape the United States' first years as a new country.
This painting shows John Adams meeting with other men to discuss the colonies' independence.
John left the farm to help the colonies break away from Great Britain. Abigail cared for their children and ran their farm. A woman running a business was not common at the time.

Monarch butterflies drink nectar, a sweet liquid made by plants, with a long tongue shaped like a tube.
Once the butterfly is able to fly, it flies off to eat. Unlike a caterpillar, a butterfly does not eat leaves. Instead, it sips sweet liquid from flowers. It also searches for a mate.
m
A female monarch butterfly may lay 400 to 500 eggs in her lifetime!
  Adult butterflies do not grow. They save their energy for flying and laying eggs. Females are bigger than males.
  A monarch butterfly may only live for two to six weeks. After she finds a mate, the female monarch lays her eggs. The butterfly life cycle starts all over again.

While the butterfly hangs, it pushes blood into its wings.
The new butterfly rests. The butterfly must hang upside down, or it will not be able to fly. Blood pumping into the wings causes them to unfold and spread out.

The young caterpillar eats its own shell. If there are two eggs on a leaf, the caterpillar will eat the other egg first!
The hungry caterpillar eats all the time. It needs a lot of food to grow. First, the caterpillar eats its own eggshell.          \ J
Then, the caterpillar eats the leaf it is on.

The caterpillar puts down sticky silk. The silk keeps the old skin in place while the caterpillar wiggles out of it.
The caterpillar grows quickly, but its skin does not grow. The caterpillar's old skin splits and peels away. The caterpillar will shed the old skin many times in this stage.

Did you know there are more than 100 breeds of chickens? Each breed has its own specialty. For example, Rhode Island Reds are known for laying lots of eggs. Silkies are small and have soft, fluffy feathers. Different breeds can live together in the same group, or flock.

Our dog, Trixie, is kind to the chickens. She even lets them eat her dog bones! Once a coyote showed up in the alley behind our house. Trixie barked to keep the chickens safe.

Our chickens depend on us to take good care of them. We keep their coop clean and fill their nesting boxes with soft bedding. In the summer, we hang a screen on their coop to keep out the hot sun.

In the beginning, chicks often need a heat lamp (top left). A young Savannah beams with a very young Sleepy in her lap (top right). Twinkle, Scott Jr., and Sleepy search the grass for food (bottom).
We bought our chickens at a feed store when they were chicks. We named them Sleepy Twinkle, and Scott Jr. (Sleepy got her name because she always fell asleep in our hands.) At first, the chicks had to live in a box with a heat lamp to keep warm. Soon they were ready to move out to their coop.

I also like the sounds that the chickens make when they lay their eggs. They say things like "rah, rah" and "bah-bock, bah-bock!" When we hear the sounds, we know that more eggs are on the way.

Twinkle lays the larger green eggs. Scott Jr. and Sleepy lay the tan and pink ones.
My favorite part about having chickens is seeing what color eggs they lay. Sometimes the shells are tan. Sometimes they are light pink or green. We eat the eggs for breakfast.

Even though my family lives in the city, our backyard is like a farm. We have a dog and three chickens. The chickens live in a coop we made with wood we found in the alley.
When Scott Jr. gets wet, she looks like she's wearing hair gel...well, feather gel.
The chickens love to go outside when it rains. The wet soil is a good place to find insects and slugs. When Scott Jr. gets wet in the rain, her feathers stand up like spiky hair. She looks so funny!

Each afternoon, our chickens eat grass, bugs, and pebbles in the yard. Chickens don't have teeth— eating pebbles helps them grind up their food. We feed the chickens corn pellets and table scraps, too. They really like grapes and watermelon.

    Flying in a V-formation helps the geese to fly long distances. The V-formation makes it easier for the geese to move through the air.
    They can cut through the air like a knife.
      The goose in the front of the formation has to work the hardest. The geese take turns flying in the front. When the goose in front gets tired, a goose from the back takes its place.
      This is how geese in a flock work together.

    In the Water
Lots of people love swimming, boating, and water sports. But every year, many people get hurt in the water. Always swim with a buddy and with an adult watching. There should be a lifeguard on duty at community swimming areas. If you swim alone, you could get hurt and someone might not see you in time.

Speed is fun—and dangerous.
    On Wheels
The best thing about wheels is going fast. But that is also the worst thing! Going fast can be dangerous. You need to protect your body when you are on wheels.

Your brain controls everything in your body. It is very important to protect your brain. Wearing a helmet will protect your brain from getting hurt.
When you fall, you put out your hands to catch yourself. You land on your wrists, knees, and elbows. Wrist, knee, and elbow pads can protect you from breaking your bones.

Always follow signs and rules. Swimming in dirty water can make you sick. If you swim where there are strong waves and currents, you could be swept away. If you dive outside diving areas, you could hit your head and injure your brain.
Boats, jet skis, and water skis usually go on lakes, rivers, and the ocean. This kind of water can have currents and waves. It might be very cold. A life jacket keeps your head above water so you do not drown.
Wearing life jackets and following signs can save your life.

On a warm spring day, the Hoppers sat in class.
“Who knows what’s happening tonight?” the teacher asked. The Hoppers raised their hands and wiggled in their seats.
“I know,” shouted Snubby Nose. “The circus is coming!”

Then one clown reached in a bag and brought out a drum. Another pulled out a flute, and the third had two horns.
Now you can play circus music at home,” said the clowns.
Snubby Nose stopped crying. He took the presents back to the other Hoppers. They played their flute and drum and horns all the way home.
12
“I’m sorry, little Hoppers, but we don’t have money for the circus,” said Mother Hopper.
The four Hoppers sat sadly on their doorstep. They didn’t want to play anymore. The only thing they could think to play was circus. They could almost smell the popcorn.

“Why so sad, Hoppers?” asked a voice. Grandpa Grizzly came up the lane.
“We can’t go to the circus because we don’t have the money,” wailed Snubby Nose.
“Oh, I think you’ll find the money,” said Grandpa Grizzly. He reached his paw into Snubby Nose’s shirt pocket and pulled out a shining silver coin.

All the students were excited. The teacher helped them cut out circus animal shapes. They made a big tent out of paper. They drew and colored a little merry-go-round. At playtime, they played trapeze on the swings. Snubby Nose played a lion, and Speedy Legs was the lion tamer. The Hoppers couldn’t wait to go to the circus.

They bought lemonade and popcorn. They saw the horses prance around the ring. They saw the trapeze artists fly in the air. Then the show was over.
“It is time to go home,” said Grandpa Grizzly. But Snubby Nose didn’t want to leave. He cried, and he screamed.

All the kids yelled questions to RK-5.
"Where are you from?"
"What else can you do?"
"How did you get here?"
"Why are you here?"
"One question at a time, please," said RK-5.
RK-5 was sitting on Tommy's lap.
He told his story.

"I am from a star called Gendroz. Our spacecraft crashed here. I was sent to find help. I was the only one on the spacecraft who can speak your language. I met your dog. I tried to speak to him. He picked me up in his mouth and shut off my power. This morning, Andy said the word, 'DOO-LALLY' to switch me on again."

At breakfast, Tommy told his father, "I'm meeting my friends at the park today."
"You must take Samantha with you," said his mother.
"Oh, no!" moaned Tommy. "Do I have to?" Tommy liked Sam, his sister. But he didn't like her playing with his friends. She was in first grade. He was in third grade.

"I don't know any magic words," said Andy.
"My Grand-dad always says 'DOO-LALLY.'
I didn't know that it's a magic word."
"If you are so smart, RK-5, can you get us out of this cage?" Tommy said to the little robot.
"I will try," said RK-5.
16
All five kids stood with their mouths open.
At last, Tommy said, "You can speak!"
"Of course I can speak," said RK-5. "I can speak any language. I can talk to animals.
I can understand anything that anyone says."
12
"Let go!" yelled Tommy
Suddenly, the clicker made a loud screeching noise. There was a flash of blue light and thick smoke. When the smoke cleared, nobody was at the park. Tommy, Andy, Lucy, Kim, Sam, and Taffy had disappeared.

They felt themselves tumbling and spinning. They bumped into each other as they flew in the air. All they could see were yellow, red, and pink stars.
At last, they fell to the ground with a bump. Kim started crying.
Sam said, "Wow, that was cool!"
"I'm sorry I tried to take the clicker," said Andy. "I didn't believe it was magic. I do now."

"Okay," said Andy, "say something to Taffy"
RK-5 barked, "Woof, woofwoof, woof-woof-woof."
Taffy replied, "Woofwoof-woof woof-woof."
"What did he say? What did Taffy say?" Sam asked.
"Taffy told me that he did not have breakfast. Tommy forgot to feed him. Tommy was in a hurry this morning."

Tommy smiled and pulled the clicker from his coat pocket. They all looked at it.
"Make it do something," said Sam.
"No, no!" said Tommy. "I don't know how it works. I don't want to be stuck in the school lunchroom again."
"I want to see it," shouted Andy. "Give it to me."
He tried to grab it from Tommy's hand. Tommy wouldn't let go. They pulled and they pushed.

The clicker suddenly jumped out of Tommy's hand. It landed on the floor and started spinning around.
When the clicker stopped spinning, two little legs slid out from the bottom. Two little arms slid out from the sides. A little head popped out of the top.
"Hello, I am RK-5. How can I help you?" squawked the clicker.

They all felt very frightened, except Taffy, who seemed happy. Tommy tried opening the door of the cage, but it was locked.
Sam started shouting, "Help, help, we're locked in a cage!"
She shouted so loudly that she woke the dogs. All the dogs started barking at once. There was a terrible noise. Even Taffy started barking.
"Stop barking—you're all driving me DOO-LALLY!" yelled Andy.
10
  After breakfast, Tommy, Sam, and Taffy ran to the park. The park was at the end of their street. Lucy, Andy, and Kim were waiting for them.
  They all shouted, "Did you bring it?"
"Did I bring what?" said Tommy.
  He pretended not to understand.
"Come on," said Lucy. "Show them the clicker. I've told them all about it."

"We're not in the zoo," whispered Tommy. "We're in the animal shelter. This is where they bring all the dogs that get lost or run away. We came here when we adopted Taffy."
"Oh no!" cried Kim, "Does that mean someone will adopt us?"

"We are in trouble again," said Lucy.
Kim stopped crying and whispered, "Look where we are. We're not in the school lunchroom. We're in a cage."
"We must be in the zoo," said Andy, "but we're inside the cage!"
Tommy looked around. He saw that there were dogs sleeping in all the other cages.
He then knew where they were.

They landed in something soft and squishy It was also stinky and smelly.
They looked around. They were in a big garbage bin. They were sitting in piles of smelly old food.
"Yuck, this is horrible. Let's get out of here," shouted Lucy.
m
They jumped out of the garbage bin and ran out of the school gates. After five minutes, they stopped to catch their breath.
"What are you going to do with the magic clicker? I think it makes trouble," said Lucy.
"I don't know," said Tommy.
They decided to ask their best friends.
They would tell them about the clicker the next day, at the park.

"I'll show Andy and Kim what the clicker can do. I may even send them to the school lunch room/' laughed Tommy.
They said goodbye and both ran home.
"What will I tell Mom about my stinky clothes?" he thought.
As he ran, he safely hid the magic clicker in his pocket.
16
They looked in, but it was as dark as night.
"Shall we try crawling in there?" asked Lucy.
Tommy picked up Taffy.
"Let's go," he yelled. "It's the only way to get out of here."
12
Tommy was very surprised. He stood still for a moment with his mouth open.
He blinked his eyes and shouted, "Where are you, Lucy? Come here, Taffy!"
He looked for them behind the bushes. He looked for them under the bench. He looked for them on top of the wall. He could not find them anywhere.

"I think I made them disappear with the clicker," he said to himself.
He tried pressing the buttons on the clicker to get his friends back. Nothing happened.
"Perhaps the batteries are dead," he thought.
But there was no place for batteries. He studied the numbers and words on the buttons of the clicker. One read "forward." He pressed it. Nothing happened. Another read "back." He pressed it. Nothing happened.
"Perhaps I should point the clicker at myself and press," he thought.

"We're in the school lunch room," answered Lucy. "But I don't know how we got here," she said.
Tommy told her that the magic clicker sent them there.
"We shouldn't be here on a Saturday," said Tommy. "We'll be in big trouble if someone finds us."
They looked for a way to get out. They tried the doors. They were locked. They tried the windows. They were locked, too.
"What can we do?" cried Lucy. "We can't stay here until Monday."

One day, Tommy was playing with his friend Lucy. Taffy ran to them. He had found a TV remote control. It was not an ordinary remote control. It was purple with red stripes.
"Where did you find this clicker?" asked Tommy.
Taffy just wagged his tail. Tommy took the clicker and started playing with the buttons.

Everything went black. Tommy fell to the ground with a bump.
He slowly opened his eyes. He looked around. He saw Lucy smiling at him.
He heard Taffy barking at him.
"Where am I?" asked Tommy.

Rain falls on Lake Itasca. It mixes into the clear waters of a river so small that a child could wade across it. So begins the mighty Mississippi River.

Other Stinky Animals
  The common musk turtle has another name— stinkpot! It smells bad when other animals disturb it. A stinky yellow liquid comes out of the back of its body.
A musk turtle can live forty to sixty years.
A female mink frog can lay 500 to 4,000 eggs at once.
The mink frog also uses smell to stay safe from enemies. It smells like rotten onions.

Protecting the Nest
   The green woodhoopoe lives in Africa. The female makes a bad smell to protect her nest. She sprays a dark, stinky liquid to keep enemies from getting too close.
Good and Stinky
Being stinky helps many plants and animals stay alive. For plants, the bad smell brings helpful insects. For animals, the bad smell may keep enemies away or help in other ways. Stinky steam, spray, throw-up, slime, and pee all help living things stay alive.

If you've ever smelled a skunk, you know it is not a nice odor. In fact, it's terrible!
Did you know that both plants and animals can smell bad? Stinky plants smell bad to get helpful insects to come near. Stinky animals often smell bad to keep enemies away. Smelling bad helps both plants and animals stay alive.
Skunks are famous for smelling bad, but some animals smell even worse!

Stinky Plants
   The corpse flower smells rotten. It makes heat and steam so insects far away will smell it. The plant's bad smell brings flies and beetles
near. These insects are looking for rotten meat to eat. Instead of rotten meat, the bugs collect powder from the flower and carry it to other corpse flowers. The powder helps more corpse flowers grow.
    A different stinky plant smells like poop! This plant's bad smell brings beetles that love poop. The smell comes from inside the plant's flowers.

places and the fight began again.
Blackbeard fought hard, but the Ranger had too many men. He was shot five times before he finally died. The Ranger's crew threw Blackbeard's body into the sea.

Blackbeard's Capture
For a time, it seemed that Blackbeard had stopped being a pirate. He got married and bought a house. People stopped worrying about him.
Blackbeard soon went back to his old life, though. He went to sea in his last ship, the Adventure.
Blackbeard began attacking other ships again.
12
The leader of the pirate crew put Edward in charge of a pirate ship. They attacked so many other ships that everyone was afraid of them.
Why did sailors become pirates?
     In those days, sailors worked very hard but made very little money. When a country was at war, any ship might be hired to attack and steal enemy ships. It was dangerous work. The hired sailors were paid a small reward for the ships or treasure they took.
     Pirates could attack any ship—even one from their own country! Pirates could keep all the ships and treasure forthemselves!
6
One day, Edward and his pirate crew took over a large, fast, French ship that they had captured.
The pirate leader gave the ship to Edward as a reward. Edward added more cannons to make it a very dangerous ship. Then he gave his ship a new name—the Queen Anne's Revenge.
The Queen Anne's Revenge and Edward soon became very famous. No ship wanted to see the fast ship and its black pirate flag chasing them. Edward was now Blackbeard, the pirate.
        The Golden Age of Piracy
   During the 1700s, European countries set up new towns in the Caribbean and North and South America.
   English, French, Dutch, and Spanish cargo ships sailed back and forth. They were easy targets for pirates.

Becoming Blackbeard
Blackbeard's real name was Edward Teach. He was born in England about 1680. When he was old enough, Edward learned to sail a ship.
England was at war. Edward joined the crew of a ship that attacked enemy ships to help the English navy. Soon, he decided it would be better to join a pirate crew, instead!
Three hundred years ago, pirates were very busy robbing ships along the coast and islands of the New World.

Sailing a large ship close to the land is hard to do. The water isn't very deep.
One day, Blackbeard, his four ships, and all of his men were sailing home with their treasure. Blackbeard sailed the Queen Anne's Revenge too close to the land. His ship got stuck in the sand near a coastal town called Beaufort.
Blackbeard told his men to move the treasure onto the other ships. He sent one of his captains away and dropped off many of his men on a nearby island.
Then, Blackbeard sailed away, taking the loot with him. Had he wrecked his ship on purpose so he could keep the treasure for himself?

Picture a pirate in your mind. Do you think of a cartoon pirate with a beard, an eye patch, and a parrot?
Three hundred years ago, real pirates did sail the seas. One pirate had a name that scared everyone. He was known as Blackbeard.

Blackbeard's black flag showed a skeleton stabbing a heart and holding an hourglass. The hourglass showed that the victim only had a short time to give up or Blackbeard would attack.
Blackbeard soon had four fast
ships and a crew of over 350 men. One time, his four ships sailed to Charleston, South Carolina. They robbed every ship sailing in or out of Charleston.
Pirate's Life for Me?
     How did Blackbeard get such a big crew? Most sailors got little pay. If a pirate attacked their ship, sailors often chose to join the pirates! Former slaves also gladly became pirates to escape slavery. Pirates often shared treasure with their crews.

Shadow clocks made it easier to tell time between sunup, noon, and sundown.
People discovered that they could use a stick and the sun to tell time.
This was called a shadow clock. They put a stick in the ground, pointing straight up. The direction of the stick's shadow and how long or short it was told them the time.

A better kind of shadow clock was called a sundial. Sundials had a pointer and a base. The pointer cast a shadow on marks around the base. People could tell time by reading the marks.
But shadow clocks were not good for telling time on cloudy days—or at night.

After Robinson stopped playing baseball in 1957, he went into business. He also continued to work for equal rights for all people. He died in 1972.
Today in the United States, more people of color play in the world of sports than ever before. We all have Number 42 to thank for that.
Robinson helped run the coffee maker Chock Full o' Nuts. He was the first black vice president of a U.S. national company. Here, he works at his desk in January 1962.

        Hugs for Daddy
The next morning when I woke up, I saw a big piece of paper on the kitchen floor. I saw markers and crayons. "I know how you can send a hug to Daddy," Mommy said. If you lie on this piece of paper, I can make a tracing of your body. We will cut it out, and you can decorate it to look like you. If we send this to Daddy, he can wrap the arms around himself each night. It will be as if you are giving him a hug good night."
I lay down, and Mommy traced around me with a marker. I filled in all the white space to make it look like me. I folded it neatly and placed it in the box with the other items to send to Daddy.

People still use smaller boats for fishing, fun, and sport.
Many boats that carry one or two people still use paddles or oars.
     Other boats used paddles or oars.
     Paddles and oars are long pieces of wood with broad, flat ends.
     They push against the water, moving the boat forward.

     Later, people made boats with wooden frames.
     They covered the frames with bark or animal skins.

        Introduction
Ships and boats carry people and goods over water.
Before cars, trains, or airplanes, boats were the fastest way to move things.
Boats continue to get bigger and faster.

Sails made from strong cloth were also used to move boats.
The sails caught the wind, and the wind pushed the boat.

Leroy was a time traveler—that's what he told himself, at least. He was in second grade, but he told himself he was only two years old.
Today was his birthday: February 29, otherwise known as leap day. That day only came once every four years, though. As far as Leroy was concerned, that meant he only had a real birthday once every four years. To Leroy, most of his eight years were just "pretend years."

"Why are they called leap years?” Leroy asked.
The librarian smiled. "Say New Year's Eve was Sunday last year. Usually that means it would be Monday this year, but in a leap year, it would be Tuesday. It would 'skip' or 'leap' ahead a full day."
Leroy laughed in amazement. He finally understood!

  Over time, people figured out that a year was not exactly 365 days," the librarian explained. "To complete a full year, you have to spin a little bit more. You need an extra quarter of a turn, or six hours, every year. In four years, that adds up to one full extra day, a special year with 366 days."
  Calendars would not work without leap years," she added. "In a hundred years, summer would start almost a month later."
10
He didn't understand why February 29 couldn't happen each year, like the other 365 days.
So much time had passed since his last real birthday, no one remembered this one. Not even his mother.
You also move a little bit in a big loop around the Sun," the librarian said. "One full loop is one year. That's 365 spins—or days—on your journey."

Conclusion
The community government is important. It makes a difference in the lives of people every day. The government gives people in a community a good and safe place to live.
14
People can make a difference in their government, too. They can run in an election. They can vote. They can speak at community meetings. They can also offer to help in parks and other places.
What can you do to make a difference?

When people break the laws, they may go to court. In court, a judge or a jury decides whether someone broke the law. A judge is the head of the court. A jury is a group of people from the community. The jury listens to both sides and decides whether someone broke the law. Sometimes there is no jury, and the judge decides. If the judge or jury decides that someone broke the law, the judge decides the punishment.
12
When people vote, they make a choice. People vote for a mayor in an election every two or four years. People vote for the person they think will be the best mayor. The person with the most votes becomes mayor.

Colorful pools and wild animals. Streams of hot water that shoot out of the ground. People can see these things and more at Yellowstone, which became the world's first national park in 1872. National parks are areas of special, protected land.
From 1995 to 1997, forty-one wild wolves were brought to Yellowstone from Canada and Montana.
People forced wolves out of Yellowstone over one hundred years ago. Later, workers for the national park brought them back. About one hundred wolves live in Yellowstone today.

Everyone was talking at the same time, including Bongo.
Tommy asked RK-5 what Bongo was saying.
"He wants to find some monkey friends at the zoo," said RK-5.
"Yes, yes! Let's go to the zoo," yelled Sam.
They all agreed it would be fun to go to the zoo. They would find some friends for Bongo.

Andy put Bongo in his backpack. They didn't want anyone at the zoo to see Bongo. The zookeeper may want to keep him at the zoo.
RK-5 asked Tommy to press "26-15-15 x 6" on the buttons that popped out of his chest. Tommy pressed the buttons.

"Hey! Look at me," said a voice behind them.
It was Sam. She was with the zookeeper.
He had a long pole with a hook on the end. He used the pole to get Sam's hat from the crocodile pen.
They said thank you to the zookeeper.
The zookeeper said, "It's time to feed the sea lions. Would you like to help?"
"Yes, please!" they shouted.

Tommy and the others found the Monkey House. Andy let Bongo out of the backpack. Bongo had a fine time chatting with his new monkey friends. Everybody laughed at the funny faces the monkeys made.
"Where's Sam?" asked Kim.
They all looked around.
"Oh, no! She's lost," said Tommy.
"Now I'm in super big trouble."

  They all ran off to visit the monkeys. They didn't see Sam stop to look at the crocodiles. Sam counted three big crocodiles. They all had lots of big, scary teeth. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew Sam's hat off. It went into the crocodile pen.
"Oh, no!" she said out loud. "I'm not going in there to get my hat. I'll find the zookeeper. He'll get my hat for me."
10
A voice shouted from behind him, "Hey, Andy!"
It was Tommy with his sister, Sam.
Lucy and Kim followed close behind.
"Is RK-5 with you?" asked Andy.
"Of course I am," said a voice from Tommy's pocket.
Tommy gently pulled the little robot from his pocket.

  Lucy pointed to a picture of the Monkey House on the sign.
  Kim said, "Here's Flamingo Hill.
  That's where we are now."
"If we walk to the end of this path and turn left, we'll be at the Monkey House," said Tommy.

  There was a flash of blue light and thick smoke. When the smoke cleared, they found themselves on a hill. There were pink flamingos all around them.
"Look! There's a path there," said Kim.
"There's a sign, which shows where all the animals are," said Tommy.
  They ran to the sign to find out where the monkeys lived.

Kite Safety
• Remember to choose an open, safe place to fly your kite.
• Don’t fly it near power lines.
• Keep it away from trees, roads, and airports.
• Don’t fly a kite in the rain or when you hear thunder.
• Be sure nothing is on the ground to trip over.
     On a breezy day take your kite to a flat, open area. Be sure that there are no power lines or big trees. Look at the ground around you. Is there anything you could trip over? Hold your kite up by the bridle and run into the wind. Let go of the kite and slowly let out some string. Then let out a little more until your kite is high in the sky.
     Happy flying!

       The inventor Ben Franklin had the idea that lightning was made of electricity. He wanted to prove his idea. One day when it was stormy he tied a metal key to a kite string. Then he flew the kite up into the storm clouds. Lightning from the storm hit his kite. The electricity ran down the
      wet string to the metal key. When he reached for the key he got a surprise. The electricity jumped from the key and gave him a shock! Do not try this yourself. It's not safe to do. When Ben Franklin tried to do it again, he was hurt badly.

Many Uses for Kites
     Some people have used kites for fishing. They put a fishhook and bait on the long kite tail. The kite tail dragged in the water. When a fish saw it, it bit the bait and was caught on the hook. Then the kite was pulled in.

   Step 2:
   Cut off a 4-foot (120 cm) piece of string. Tape each end of the string to each end of the long stick. This string is called the bridle. Tie one end of the rest of the string to the middle of the bridle.
   Step 3:
   Lay the cross on the open plastic bag. Cut a diamond shape around it. Make sure to cut the diamond shape wider than the ends of the sticks.

Kites were named after the kite bird. The kite bird has wide wings and easily floats high in the sky. No one knows who made the first kite. But one famous Chinese story about a kite was written over 2,000 years ago. The story is about a man who used a kite to attack a fort. He couldn't find a way to get inside the fort. So he tied himself to a huge kite. He flew over the wall of the fort and scared the soldiers!

When the monkey stopped talking, RK-5 turned to the children and told them what the monkey said.
"The monkey's name is Bongo. He lived at the seaside in his country. One day, he saw a big box of bananas near the seashore. He was very hungry, so he jumped into the box to get a banana. He heard someone coming. He hid under the bananas.
m
"Someone nailed a top onto the box. Then he felt the box moving. The box was being loaded onto a ship, and the ship sailed here.
"It took a very long time to get here, so when the sailors opened the box, there was only one banana left. Bongo had eaten all of the others. The sailors were very angry and took Bongo to the animal shelter."

"Don't worry, Bongo. You are safe with us," said Andy. "We will take care of you.
You can make a house in these tall trees in the park. We'll bring you food every day." They watched Bongo climb the highest tree.

At last, they reached the big, blue bench. They always met at the big, blue bench. It was their favorite place in the park.
When Tommy got his breath back he said, "We've got a lot of questions for you, RK-5."
Sam said, "We've got a lot of questions for the monkey, too."

"We'll have to get out before the big doors open," said Sam. "I don't want to be adopted. I already have a nice family and a good home."
At that moment there was a loud screeching sound. The kids covered their ears with their hands.
"Look, look!" said Kim. "It's a baby monkey. In that red box in the next cage."

"RK-5, can you speak monkey language?" asked Andy.
"Of course I can," replied RK-5. "I can speak any language. I can speak to any animal."
"Please ask the monkey if he can get us out of this cage," said Kim.

The dogs became quiet when RK-5 barked a question to them. A little spotted dog barked back at RK-5. Then a large black dog joined in. Soon a lot of the other dogs barked in turn.
"What are they saying?" asked Lucy.

Special hot-air balloons can fly very high.
Interviewer: How high can you go?
Dan: Some people take balloons ten miles in the air. They have to wear oxygen tanks so they have enough air to breathe. But most stay within two miles of the surface.

    Introduction
Flying hot-air balloons is a fun and beautiful sport. Bright balloons fly slowly and silently through the air. Dan Saul has been flying hot-air balloons since 1979.

Interviewer: How do you make the balloon go up and down?
Dan: There is a hole at the top of the balloon. We can open and close it with a cord. To go down, we open the hole to let out hot air. To go up, we close the hole.
The parachute, or center circle of fabric at the top of a hot-air balloon, opens and closes to move a balloon up and down.

    Interviewer: How do you steer?
Dan: The wind goes in different directions at different heights. We go up and down to find wind that goes the way we want to go. We fly just after sunrise or before sunset. That's when the winds are best.

Paper wasp nests come in a variety of shapes and styles.
Paper Wasp Nests
Paper wasps chew bits of wood and plants to make a soft nest. The nest is made up of cells that look like an egg carton. Wasp eggs grow in the cells. As the wasps grow in number, the nest gets bigger.

Little Ants, Big City
   Researchers found a huge, empty underground city in Brazil, once the home of leafcutter ants. In order to build their home, each insect would have carried loads of earth more than half a mile (0.8 km)—over and over. In total, the ants moved around 45 tons (40 mt) of soil to create their network of tunnels.

Two famous volcanoes are in the park.
A Volcano Wonderland
Every day on the island of Hawaii, lava seeps from a volcano on the edge of the ocean. When the lava cools, it turns into rock and makes the island a little bigger. This volcano is part of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.
Every year, over one million people visit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. National parks are areas of protected land.

A picture from the 1870s shows the eruption of one of the park's volcanoes.
In 1868, an eruption caused earthquakes that lasted four days and destroyed nearly forty buildings.

Suddenly, to Chen's surprise, the emperor shouted, "I've found the next emperor! I don't know how the rest of you grew your flowers. The seeds I gave out were boiled. They could never have grown. But this child was honest and used his best effort to try to grow the seed."
14
Chen and his mother went to live in the palace. The emperor and Chen worked in the palace garden together. When the emperor died, Chen became emperor. He cared for China just as he had always cared for his own garden.

Days passed, but the little seed didn't sprout.

"What's this?" the emperor demanded. "Why is your pot empty?" he asked.
Chen said, "I'm sorry. I put the seed in a pot. I moved it into a bigger, fancier pot. I made sure it had sunlight. I gave it the freshest water. I even let my cricket keep it company at night! No matter what I did, it wouldn't grow. I tried my best."

A year passed.
It was time to bring the pot back to the emperor's palace. Chen was sad. His seed hadn't sprouted at all.
His mother found him crying in the garden. "You did your best," she said. "Bring your pot to the emperor and tell him what happened."
10
The emperor of China was a very old man. He didn't have any children. He worried about who would become the next emperor.

He kept his pet cricket next to the pot. He wanted the seed to hear the cricket's sweet sounds.
Seasons passed, but the little seed still didn't sprout.

Anna hung Opa's magic coat on a hook.
   "Who wants to play Red Rover?" Jayda asked.
   "I do!" said Anna, and she ran, quick as lightning, to play.
    Anna looked out her grandmother's window as dark clouds piled up in the sky. "I hope it doesn't rain, Oma," Anna said.
   "Remember what Opa told you," Oma said. "A little rain makes all things better."
   "Not school picnics," said Anna.

At last, it was time to eat. But Anna was so hot in the magic coat that her tummy hurt. She couldn't eat one bite.
"Darn this magic coat!" Anna said. "What fun is a picnic with no games or food?"

"Magic coat?" asked Anna.
   "It's the long coat, gray as a cloud, that hangs by the door," Oma said.
    Quick as lightning, Anna ran to get the coat.

"A sailor gave it to Opa long ago/' said Oma. "Whoever wears it can choose the weather."
Anna put on the coat. "Oof, magic coats are heavy/' she said.

    Anna peeked at the blue sky. She undid the top button of Opa's coat, and a breeze tickled her cheek. She undid the second button, and the breeze blew stronger.
    She undid the third, and a black cloud went over the sun.
  "Oh well, I don't like tag anyway," said Anna. She buttoned up the coat, and the sun came back.

"True," Oma nodded, "rain and picnics are not so good."
   Anna looked at the box of cupcakes with pink icing.
    Oma and Anna had worked hard on them. "Rain is not good for cupcakes, either," said Anna.

"You could run better without your coat," Ms. Storm said.

She took her cupcakes, ran outside, and shouted at the rain clouds, "Begone!"
At once, a wind played at Anna's feet. It lifted the bottom of Opa's coat and spun up into the sky. The wind sliced through the clouds, and the sky turned blue.
It works!" sang Anna.
Wait!" called Oma, but Anna was too far away to hear.

    Formation
Time and erosion helped form the Grand Canyon. Erosion happens when bits of the ground are worn away. For millions of years, the Colorado River ran over and wore away the earth until a canyon was made. The rocks at the bottom of the canyon are almost two billion years old.
The Colorado River wears away soil, rock, and other materials, making the Grand Canyon deeper every day.
