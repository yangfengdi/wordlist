They told me I had been accepted to Richmond, the best high school in town! Hallie and I had applied a few months earlier; our fathers had attended that school together and it was our dream to do the same now. Hallie and I hugged each other happily and I told her to hurry home and come back with her letter of acceptance.
Two hours later, when Hallie still hadn’t come back, I started to get worried and called her. "Oh, yes," she said, "I wasn’t accepted." I was shocked. It had been our dream for so long. We’d always known we’d go to high school together. How could I go to school without my best friend? "If you’re not going, I don’t think I want to go either," I said. Hallie instantly sounded happier and friendlier and we agreed to meet the next day and play basketball.
Then I went downstairs to tell my parents I wasn’t going to Richmond. They were shocked and asked why. I explained about Hallie not being accepted and how I didn’t want to go without her. "The fact your friend wasn’t accepted doesn’t mean you have to give up this opportunity," my mother said. "You have worked very hard for a few years to get into Richmond because you really wanted to, and you shouldn’t give it up now." But I still wasn’t convinced. "It wouldn’t be fair to Hallie," I said. "She wants to go too." Then my father asked me, "What about you? Do you want to go to Richmond?" I thought about it for a minute and answered yes, I did want to go, but I couldn’t do it to my friend. "If she’s such a good friend, she wouldn’t want you to give up on your dream for her," my father said. "You two can still be best friends, but you don’t have to be in school together. It’s your dream and your opportunity. Go for it."

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.

8. Read the passage. Frederick was walking down the long avenue that led from school to his house when he saw an old beggar sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a wall, his eyes closed and his hand outstretched. Frederick knew it was rude to stare, but decided to give the man a little money in case he was hungry. As Frederick drew closer, he noticed the old beggar was rocking back and forth, muttering indistinctly under his breath. Frederick leaned in to listen and realized the beggar was, in fact, singing: "Lonely lasses, lazy lads, Cherubs in clouds and cinnamon bread. They weep and sweep and fall asleep. I turn to gaze at the red sky instead." Although Frederick could not perceive the meaning of the song, he was still impressed and put twice as much money as he had intended in the beggar's outstretched hand. As he walked away, he looked back and saw that although the beggar had not changed his position at all, his eyes were now open and he was nodding at him in gratitude. Which of the following is an example of alliteration?
A. lonely lasses, lazy lads B. cherubs in clouds and cinnamon bread C. they weep and sweep and fall asleep D. muttering indistinctly under his breath

1. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Line a cake pan with parchment and spray well with nonstick cooking spray. Whisk together all the dry ingredients—the flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder in a small bowl, which you will set aside for the moment. 2. Cube the butter and place it in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir occasionally as the butter melts. Add the sugar and stir until it all melts. 3. Before the mixture comes to a boil, remove the pan from the heat and let it cool a little. Once it has cooled, add one egg at a time, and whisk well in-between. The initially grainy mixture should become shiny and smooth as you add the eggs. Add the vanilla and whisk well once again. Now add the ingredients from the bowl you set aside earlier and stir them in with a spatula. 4. Scrape the brownie batter into the prepared pan and bake it for 24 minutes, until a toothpick comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached. Cool the brownie cake completely before proceeding. When should the dry ingredients be added to the wet mixture? A. in the beginning, when they are all mixed together B. after the butter comes to a boil C. after the wet mixture becomes shiny and smooth D. just before the mixture is stirred and scraped into the pan
10.Read the passage. Eugene thought he and his little sister were too old to have a babysitter, but their parents, evidently, thought otherwise and insisted on bringing one every time they went out. They have endured some horrific babysitters, including one that sent them to bed at seven o'clock, and another who broke the DVD and then blamed it on them. But this one, their parents promised, was different. Even though Eugene doubted it, he had promised his parents to give her a chance. The babysitter was about seventeen years old, and her name was Laurel. As soon as their parents left, she asked Eugene and his sister Kathleen what they wanted to do. They wanted to watch television. Laurel joined them, but after about twenty minutes, she turned it off. "Hey, we were watching that!" Eugene protested. "Oh, but I've got something much more interesting for us to do," Laurel replied. "I'm going to tell you a story." Eugene and Kathleen exchanged gloomy looks. They were not in the mood for a story. They wanted to watch TV. But Laurel seemed so determined that they kept quiet. Laurel took a chair and sat in front of them.

"I want to tell you about something that happened to me two days ago," Laurel began. "I was in the supermarket when a very old lady that I had never seen before came up to me and asked me if I was interested in a deal. I didn't know what she was offering, so I said, why not. She beckoned me over to a part of the supermarket I had never seen before, which was much darker than the rest of the store, with all kinds of strange products in languages I couldn't read…" Eugene and Kathleen listened with their mouths open. A few minutes later, Laurel paused, took a deep breath and asked: "So, would you like to watch TV now?" "No! No! Go on!" they both protested at once. Laurel grinned and went on. She kept telling them stories until their parents came back. As soon as she left, Eugene and Kathleen told their parents they would never agree to have another babysitter except for Laurel. "And can you please go out again tomorrow?" Kathleen added. Laurel turning off the television is an example of which kind of technique?
A. alliteration B. rising action C. imagery D. irony
11.Read the passage. Singapore is the only country in the world in which chewing gum is completely banned. The idea to ban chewing gum completely was first brought to the Prime Minister of Singapore in 1983. It had been reported for several years that chewing gum was causing maintenance and cleaning problems: vandals were leaving spent gum in mailboxes, inside keyholes and on elevator buttons, which were all difficult to get rid of and sometimes caused damage. Chewing gum left on floors and bus seats proved hard to clean and damaged cleaning equipment. In 1987 the railway system started running. The Singapore government had invested several billions in that railway system, and it was soon reported that vandals had started sticking chewing gum on train door sensors, preventing the doors from functioning well and disrupting the train movement. When Goh Chok Tong was elected as the new prime minister in 1992, he decided to restrict the distribution of chewing gum and after a short transition period in which stores were allowed to clear existing stock, the sale of chewing gum was banned, except for medical reasons. What is the structure of the passage?
A. cause and effect B. order of importance C. compare and contrast D. chronology

12.Read the passage. Minnie was reading a book when her younger brother Chuck came home and walked past her bedroom. "What are you doing?" he asked, poking his head inside. "As you can see, I'm reading," said Minnie without looking up. "So, nothing important then. Listen, a new family has just moved into the old Miller house. You have to see what they've done with their front yard!" Minnie put the book aside and ran out with Chuck. The sun was like a big ball of fire in the sky and both children were sweating, but they kept running all the way down the street until they reached the old Miller house. There, Minnie stopped running and stood there, aghast. The front yard of the large house she had known her whole life had been filled with garden gnomes—small, ugly lawn ornaments, at least twenty of them, each one wearing different clothes and standing a different way. Some were grinning, some were frowning, and one was lying in a hammock, apparently asleep. The gnomes were by no means the only ornaments the new family had chosen to decorate the yard with: there was a giant gorilla, seven dancing dogs, and a whole pack of flamingoes. Minnie gaped at the figurines. Some of them were particularly appealing, like the dogs, while others, like the gnomes, were not. However, it was the sheer numerosity that made her feel shocked. "I think, as far as lawn ornaments are concerned, maybe less is more," she whispered to Chuck. "Yes," said Chuck. "But let's hope they have nice kids we can play with." Which of the following is a paradox?
A. the sun was like a big ball of fire B. stopped running and stood there C. seven dancing dogs D. less is more

14.Read the passage. Sidewalks exist on almost every street, and though most are plain-looking, some are decorated. Sidewalk chalk art is found in many big cities in Europe and North and South America. One famous sidewalk chalk artist is Julian Beever, who is originally from the UK and has been creating drawings on sidewalks around the world since the mid-1990s. His drawings create the illusion of three dimensions: some feature holes in the sidewalk, that look so real that pedestrians walk around them instead of crossing them. Others feature extremely realistic swimming pools, dungeons, and scenes from famous movies. Boston sidewalks, another example of sidewalk art, feature a selection of poems that can only be seen when it rains. The poems were painted with a special paint that only appears when covered by fluids. The city of Boston and Mass Poetry, a non-profit organization, formed a collaboration called "Raining Poetry" and began painting the poems on the sidewalks in April 2016 in honor of National Poetry Month. Which of the following is a difference between Beever's sidewalk drawings and Boston's sidewalk poetry, according to the passage?
A. Beever's sidewalk drawings were created by an individual, while the sidewalk poetry was initiated by a collaboration. B. Beever's sidewalk drawings were created with chalks, while the sidewalk poetry was created with permanent paint. C. Beever's sidewalk drawings never feature poems. D. None of Beever's sidewalk drawings were painted on sidewalks in Boston.
15.Read the passage. Fleas are small flightless insects that live as parasites on animals' bodies. They typically live on fur or feathers, their strong claws preventing them from being dislodged. They feed on the blood of their host, which might be a dog, a cat, a bird, a reptile, or a human, but a flea can live more than a hundred days without eating. Imagine not eating for a hundred days! The female flea consumes 15 times her own body weight in blood every day; imagine eating 1300 pounds of pasta in one day! One final and amazing fact is that fleas can jump up to eight inches, which is approximately 200 times their own height. That is the same as you jumping to the top of the Empire State Building. How does the author pull the reader into the text?

1. Read the passage. Andrea's six-year-old brother, Martin, was always irritating her. He would follow her around the house wherever she went. He would ask her what she was doing several times a minute, even when she was only sitting and reading a book or playing with her phone. If Andrea asked for spaghetti at dinner, Martin had to have the same food. He took clothes from her closet without permission, tried them on, and wanted to wear them to school before their mother stopped him. He begged Andrea to take him when she went to meet her friends, but even though she repeatedly refused, he was so persistent that their mother made Andrea take him with her. One day, Andrea came back home to find her geography book had been destroyed: Martin had taken it and written his name on every page in red paint, so the book was so wet and sticky with paint it could no longer be used. "That's it!" Andrea shrieked. "This is the last straw, Martin! You are never coming anywhere near me or my things again!" Martin stood and stared at her with tears in his eyes. He tried to say something, but Andrea's fury was so intimidating that he was too afraid to talk. She slammed her door and decided she would never talk to him again. A few hours later, when Andrea came downstairs for dinner, she was shocked to find the kitchen had been decorated with balloons, and there was a chocolate cake on the table with her name on it. "It's not my birthday," she said, bewildered. "Mom helped me to do it for you," said Martin, stepping in from behind her. Andrea turned around to look at him. "I'm sorry about your book," he said, with tears in his eyes again. "I only did it because I wanted you to remember me when you're in class. I'm sorry." Andrea hugged him, and they made up at once. Why did Martin do all the things that made Andrea so angry, such as following her around and wearing her clothes?
A. because he liked following people B. because he wanted to be more like her C. because he thought their parents loved her more than they loved him D. because he wanted to make her angry

on everybody. They constantly switched the sugar with the salt at the dinner table, so their father's coffee was undrinkable. They would crank call the neighbors, no matter how often their parents made them apologize. Their favorite trick, though, was switching places. At school, they would always switch places, each making his friends believe he was his own brother, then burst out laughing. They always confessed after a while, unless they used this trick for tests. For Dylan and Connor had a secret: they would switch places and take exams for each other. Since Dylan was more mathematical than Connor, and Connor was more gifted at English, Dylan would take Connor's math exams while Connor would take Dylan's English exams. Therefore, on the day of Connor's math final, they came to school as usual, ready to switch places at the right moment. However, as Connor walked into the classroom in the morning, his mouth dropped open in horror: his mother was standing there, eyeing him sternly. "W-what are you doing here?" Connor stammered. "I am your substitute teacher today, Connor," said his mother. "Please take your seat."
A. Every trickster might be caught. B. Be respectful of others. C. Appearances may be deceiving. D. Twins whose mother is a teacher must study hard.
3. Read the passage. "Frisson" is a French term for chills of pleasure, which many people get while listening to certain musical pieces, looking at beautiful artwork, or watching a moving scene from a movie. About two-thirds of the population occasionally experience frisson. The more engaged a person is in a piece of music or art, the more likely he or she is to experience frisson. Typically, frisson causes goosebumps, and scientists have been trying to discover why. Goosebumps is a skin reaction which typically occurs after a rapid change in temperature. The hairs on our skin are raised, then lowered, which creates a layer of warmth. However, since this is a physiological reaction, and frisson is psychological, science has yet to explain why frisson may cause goosebumps. Studies have tried to explain why some people experience frisson while others do not. It has been shown that people who experience frisson also score high for a personality trait called "openness to experience," and are more imaginative and curious than other people. According to the passage, it is likely that:
A. The same musical piece will make everyone feel frisson, as long as they are able to experience it.

B. Goosebumps is one of the symptoms of frisson. C. Frisson is meant to keep humans warm. D. High levels of imagination might stop a person from feeling frisson.
4. Read the passage. Every summer, millions of people experience brain freeze, typically when eating ice cream. What is brain freeze, and what causes it? Brain freeze, also known as ice cream headache, is a pain, usually a headache, that occurs when consuming cold beverages or food, such as ice cream. Typically, the consumption is quick, and consuming those slowly could prevent brain freeze. When something cold touches the roof of the mouth, it causes a nerve response, which leads to rapid constriction and swelling of blood vessels. It is possible to suffer from brain freeze in both hot and cold weather, because it is the temperature of the food or beverage being consumed, not the environment. It has been observed that other animals, such as cats, can also experience brain freeze. To ease the pain, it is recommended to press your tongue against the roof of your mouth to warm the area, tilt your head back for twenty seconds, drink something warm, or breathe in through your mouth and out through your nose. Which of the following sentences from the text contradicts the assumption that brain freeze cannot be experienced in winter?
A. Every summer, millions of people experience brain freeze, typically when eating ice cream. B. Brain freeze, also known as ice cream headache, is a pain, usually a headache, that occurs when consuming cold beverages or food, such as ice cream. C. It is possible to suffer from brain freeze in both hot and cold weather, because it is the temperature of the food or beverage being consumed, not the environment. D. It has been observed that other animals, such as cats, can also experience brain freeze.

7. Read the passage. Princess Anne was the daughter of a king who was known for his stupidity. People always said she would never be smart because of her father, and that she would be just as bad a ruler as he was. Her father had passed away when she was very young, and Princess Anne's mother, the Queen, encouraged her daughter to read books and study hard. "When you are queen, you are going to need to know so much," she told her. "Now is the time to work hard on your studies, because when you are queen, you will not have the time to study. You will have a kingdom to run." On every single birthday, the Queen gave her daughter a textbook as a birthday present. The Princess met her true love, Prince Leopold, in the grand ball on her eighteenth birthday, and from then on, they were inseparable. When Prince Leopold was about to leave on a long journey with his parents to the City of Periculo, also known as the Dangerous City, he came to bid Anne farewell and leave her a single red rose. "Know that I will always love you," he said, "and even though I am going on this excursion and we may not see each other again, I will cherish our love." As soon as Prince Leopold left, the Queen suddenly fell ill and her life was in danger. Many people hovered over her bed night and day, and, in her absence, Princess Anne was required to attend to the needs of the Kingdom. Fortunately, thanks to everything she had learned from her mother and the books she'd read since she was young, she always had the answers she needed and managed to run the Kingdom as well as attend to her mother's sickbed, all at the same time.

8. Read the passage. Bottlenose dolphins communicate with each other using body language and high-pitched whistles. Since sound travels faster through water than air, it is very useful for dolphins. When a dolphin hears another dolphin's whistle, it will often whistle itself or move toward the whistler. It has also been found that each dolphin develops its own distinctive whistle, called a signature whistle, which serves as a means of individual identification, much like a name. When dolphins are in a group, many of them whistle at once. The fact that each whistle is distinctive might help them keep track of each other. Scientists have recorded some of those signature whistles. When they played a signature whistle to the dolphin who announced it, the dolphin responded back with the same call. When the scientists played the whistles to a group of dolphins, the dolphins responded a little to whistles made by familiar dolphins from the same population, but did not respond at all to whistles made by unfamiliar dolphins. When a member of a dolphin group is missing, the group can call that dolphin's signature whistle to signal it. When dolphins get separated, they often whistle to each other until they are reunited. If you play a signature whistle to a group of dolphins which includes the dolphin with that signature whistle, and all the dolphins in the group know each other, it is likely that
A. all the dolphins will make the same response. B. the dolphin with that signature whistle will respond, but none of the others will. C. the dolphin with that signature whistle will respond, and some of the others will, too. D. none of the dolphins will respond.

9. Read the passage. The dodo was a bird that lived on the island of Mauritius until the seventeenth century. Nowadays, it is extinct. It was a large, flightless bird, with a long beak and gray plumage. It had no natural predators on the island. When Dutch settlers came to Mauritius in the sixteenth century, they hunted numerous dodos and ate their meat. They also introduced animals that were new to the island, including dogs, cats, macaques, and pigs. Some of those animals escaped captivity and became feral, and they began plundering dodo nests and eating their eggs. Since the dodo only laid one egg per season, the number of eggs decreased quickly and the dodo population declined drastically, until the dodo went extinct in the middle of the seventeenth century. Which of the following sentences describes the sequence of events in the passage?
A. Dutch settlers hunted all the dodos, leading to their extinction. B. The dodo went extinct because it could not fly. C. The dodo went extinct before the Dutch settlers came to Mauritius. D. The dodo went extinct because of hunting and predators eating its eggs.

My friends, thank you for joining us today. I feel pride and gratitude for the children of our country; it pains me to see how many of them have stopped believing in themselves. It is my job to bring back the self-confidence of our youth. Like any other country, this country has several issues to deal with. There is the energy crisis. There is a financial crisis. But how can we ever hope to overcome these crises, I ask you, without investing our best efforts into educating future generations and hope they will be able to do a better job than us running this country? We often hear the phrase "children of our future," but what does it truly mean? Our children's test scores are very low in comparison with other first-world countries. This was not always the case; it is a phenomenon that stems from the neglect of the last generation. It is my belief that thus far, the tax dollars have not been used to change that. For example, I have pushed for a merit-based bonus system for the teachers: a teacher whose students do better on national tests will receive a higher bonus. If elected, I intend to enforce that bonus system and put a special emphasis on ensuring the math and science test scores are improved. I believe that our children can achieve high results with a bit of hard work and a lot of encouragement. Which of the following is the best summary of the speech? A. Education should be at top of the political priority. Children in this country are currently not doing well on tests. I intend to improve that by enforcing a bonus system for the teachers that will benefit teachers with students who do better on national tests, and focusing my efforts on the math and science test scores. B. Thank you for coming. It is very important to me that you are here today. This country has several problems, the most important of which is our education and the fact that children are receiving low scores on national tests. I intend to work on that problem and my main suggestion is implementing a merit-based bonus system for the teachers. C. What does the phrase "children of our future" mean? It means that with a lot of hard work, our children can do much better on national tests. I intend to make sure this will happen. D. Our tax dollars have not been used to change the problem with the education system, and this is what I intend to change. I will work hard to ensure that all children do better on national tests, especially math and science which will help the future generations run this country better.

Small birds were flying around and chirping, but as the children kept walking, they could hear fewer and fewer birds. The trees were growing further apart now, and they could see the sky. Suddenly, they came to a clearing. They looked around them, unsure where to go next. Then, before they could reach a decision, they heard thunder in the distance and the sky above them turned dark almost at once. They looked up and saw clouds gathering up quickly—a storm was coming. Heavy raindrops started to fall all around them and the thunder grew louder and closer. What does the storm in the story symbolize? A. sadness B. a surprise C. danger D. anger
