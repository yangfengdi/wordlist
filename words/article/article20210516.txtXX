Manuel Vera is 71 years old. He lives in Maryland. He realized that homes must be full of old bikes. Children outgrow them. Some people stop riding them. He wanted to get these old bikes back on the road.

In 2020, he sent a message to his neighbors. It said he would fix their bikes for free.

Mr. Vera fixed 104 bicycles in the last year. He ran out of bikes to work on. In November he sent another note around. He asked if people had unused bikes. He would fix them up and give them away.

Mr. Vera gives the bikes away at a park. He says it is the perfect place.

Memories Of Learning To Ride A Bike

Most of the neighbors are working-class people. Many are immigrants. An immigrant is someone who moves to a new country.

Bikes can be expensive. Many people cannot pay for one. Still, everyone should have a bike, he said.

Sometimes, Mr. Vera will see a bicycle he fixed. It makes him think about his boyhood. He grew up in Peru. His father taught him to ride. He remembers when his father first let go of the bike.

It was a surprise to ride by himself. He could go wherever his bike might take him.

The Polynesian people were explorers. They sailed all over the South Pacific Ocean. Polynesians did not use compasses to travel. Instead, they studied the winds and stars. They tracked ocean currents and the paths of migratory birds.

Polynesia is in the South Pacific Ocean. It is a collection of more than  1,000 islands.

Polynesians traveled in voyaging canoes. They brought plants for their new home. One important plant was taro. Taro is a root vegetable. It is similar to a potato. The Polynesians also brought pigs, chickens and dogs.

The First Hawaiian People

Polynesians arrived in Hawai'i about 1,500 years ago. They were the first people on the islands. In time they became Native Hawaiians.

Native Hawaiians are also called ʻŌiwi.

Early Native Hawaiians farmed, hunted and gathered food. Taro was an important crop. It was cooked and mashed into a paste. This food is known as poi. Poi was an important part of Hawaiian diets.

believed that gods were all around in nature. Priests were known as kahuna. The priests managed temples. They also made sure people obeyed kapu.

Kapu was a set of rules. These were rules for life in early Hawai'i. For example, men and women could not eat together.

Ships Brought Explorers, Goods And Trouble

Native Hawaiians enjoyed many activities. These included surfing, boxing and wrestling.

But in 1778, life changed for the ʻŌiwi. Captain James Cook was an English explorer. He arrived on the islands with ships. Soon, other Europeans and Americans followed.

Europeans brought many changes to Hawai'i. They introduced their religion and their ways of government. Traders and ships brought goods from faraway places. They also brought diseases. These diseases caused thousands of Native Hawaiians to die.

Hawai'i Becomes A U.S. State

Honolulu is a city on the island of O'ahu. By the late 1800s, Honolulu became the main harbor. Ships arrived from all over the world.

Sugar is a major crop for Hawai'i. American businessmen owned many large sugarcane farms there. These Americans wanted to control the government. In 1891, Americans took control of the islands. Seven years later, Hawai'i joined the United States as a territory. It became the 50th state in 1959.

Polynesian traditions are still a part of island life. Hawaiian words are used in everyday language. Flower leis and hula dances are also Polynesian traditions. Today, they are found all over the Hawaiian islands.
