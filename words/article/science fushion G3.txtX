Look for a Question

mku；
[iF

Science is a way of looking at the world and
thinking about it. When you think like a scientist,
you ask questions about the world around you.
You try to answer your questions by doing
investigations.
Some investigations are simple, such as watching
animals play. Other investigations take planning.
You need to gather and set up materials. Then you
write down what happens.
You can think like a scientist on your own or in
a group. Sharing what you learn is part of the fun.
So get started!

Why does a
compass point
north?
What do stars
look like through a

telescope?

What Do
You See?
So you want to think like a scientist? Let’s get started. Try making some observations and inferences!
Active RMclill^ As you read these two pages, find and underline the definition of observe.
Look at the pictures on this page.
What do you see? When you use your senses to notice details, you observe.
Things you observe can start you thinking. Look at the picture of the small sailboat. You see that it has more than one sail. Now look more closely. The sails are different shapes and sizes.
You might infer that the shape or size of the sails affects how the boat moves. When you infer, you offer an explanation of what you observed. You might infer that each sail helps the boat move in a different way.

People ask questions all day long. But not
all questions are science questions. Science
questions can be answered in many ways.
hi
As you read these two pages, circle a common,
everyday word that has a different meaning in science.
w

I


Exploring
Some science questions can be
answered by exploring. Say you see a
leaf float by on the water. You wonder
what else can float on water. You find an
eraser in your pocket. You predict, or
use what you know to tell if it will sink
or float. When you know which items
float and which don't, you can
classify, or group, them.
Predict
Think about each item pictured. Then
circle the ones you predict will float.
Mark an Xon those you predict will sink.

^ eba

Investigating
You might think of an investigation as looking for clues. In science, an investigation is a planned way of finding answers to questions. When you do an investigation, you might ask a cause-and-effect question, ''Does the amount of weight in a boat affect whether it floats or sinks?" Because you don’t want to use a real boat, you can make and use models. A raft made of sticks is not exactly like a real boat, but it can be used to learn about them.

What Onisha Did …
Onisha thought about rafts floating down a river. She asked a question, ''Does the size of a raft affect
the amount of weight it can carry?
Onisha hypothesizes that a bigger raft can carry more weight. Then she predicted, wl should be able to add more weight to a bigger raft than to a smaller raft/' Onisha planned an investigation called an experiment Outside of science, experimenting means trying something new, such as a new recipe. In science, an experiment is a test done to gather evidence. The evidence might support the hypothesis, or it might not.
In her experiment, Onisha built three model rafts that differed only in their number of planks.
She carefully put one penny at a time onto
Variable
The factor that is changed in an experiment is called a variable. It's important to change only one variable at a time.

Now do the experiment to test your hypothesis.

Analyze your results, and draw a conclusion. Ask yourself, uDo the results support my hypothesis?” Share your conclusion with others.

ActiygiRgadihqj As you read these two
pages, circle words or phrases that signal when things are alike and different.
Closer, Closest!
Magnifying tools make objects look larger. Hold a hand lens close to one eye. Then move the hand lens closer to the object until it looks large and sharp. A magnifying box is like a hand lens in that it also has one lens. You can put things that are hard to hold, such as a bug, in it.
A microscope magnifies objects that are too tiny to be seen with the eye alone. Its power is much greater than that of a hand lens or magnifying box. Most microscopes have two or more lenses that work together.
Draw a picture of how something you see might look if it was magnified.

for each
way

ActiveRM<linq| As you read the next page, circle the main idea.
Length, Mass, and v°,ur^®
Every tool has its purpose! You can measure length with rulers and tape measures. Mass is the amount of matter in an object. It is measured with a pan balance. Volume is the amount of space a solid, liquid, or gas takes up.
The volume of a liquid can be measured with a graduated cylinder or a measuring cup or spoon. You can also use these tools to find the volume of solids that can be poured, such as sugar or salt. You use numbers to report measurements and compare objects. You can also order things using measurements. You can put pencils in order from shortest to longest.
Measuring cups and spoons are used because the amount of each ingredient is very important.
A graduated cylinder has units of volume marked on its side.

How long did that earthquake shake? Which freezes faster, hot water or cold water? Scientists need tools to answer these questions!
When you count the steady drip of a leaky faucet, you are thinking about time. You can use time and space relationships. Clocks and stopwatches are tools that measure time. The base unit of time is the second. One minute is equal to 60 seconds. One hour is equal to 60 minutes.

When you say that ovens are hot or freezers are cold, you are thinking about temperature.
A thermometer is the tool used to measure temperature. The base units of temperature are called degrees, but all degrees are not the same.
Scientists usually measure temperature in degrees Celsius. Most people around the world use Celsius, too. In the United States, however, degrees Fahrenheit are used to report the weather, body

Fish?
To care for tropical fish, you have to think like a scientist and use science tools.
Close Encounters
A public aquarium [uh«KWAiR*ee«uhm] is the place to see sharks and tropical fish. That's where many people get excited about keeping tropical fish at home. The word aquarium is used for both the big place you visit and the small tank in your home. Caring for both takes similar skills： observing, inferring, measuring, and recording data.

Keep Good Records
Keeping good records is important, whether you're recording data in your science notebook or making entries in your aquarium log. In your log, record the temperature every time you check it. Write the time you feed the fish and the volume of food you give them. Making correct measurements is part of being a good scientist.

She studied her data. Scientists use data as evidence to decide whether a hypothesis is or is not supported. Either way, scientists learn valuable things.
Scientists ask other scientists a lot of questions. They compare data. They repeat the investigation to see if they get the same results. Scientists review and talk about the evidence. They agree and disagree while respecting each other’s ideas.

Scientists might live too far away to meet face to face. What are three other ways they can share data and discuss evidence?

After you gather data, you can share, or communicate, it with others in different ways. How can you record data? To show how birds get seeds from a feeder, you can use a camera. If you observe how a dog cares for her puppies, write in a journal.
Sometimes scientists use charts and graphs to help interpret and display data. A chart is a display that organizes data into rows and columns. A data table is a kind of chart for recording numbers. A bar graph is used to compare data about different events or groups. Bar graphs make it easier to see patterns or relationships in data.

How To Do It!
What are some ways to display data? You can use data tables，bar graphs, and line graphs. How can students use displays to show what they observed in the butterfly garden?
Active Rgaqijiq As you read these two pages, draw boxes around two clue words that signal a sequence, or order.


DATA TABLE
How do you create a graph? First, look at the data table.
Each column has a heading telling what information is in that column. Now, look at the graphs. Did you notice that the same headings are used to name the parts of the graphs?
On the graphs, look at the line next to the heading ''Number of Butterflies." It looks like a number line, starting at zero and getting larger. It shows the number of butterflies.
To complete the bar graph, find the name of a month along the bottom. Then, move your finger up until you reach the number of butterflies for that month. Draw a bar to that point. To complete the line graph, draw points to show the number of butterflies for each month. Then, connect the points.

An engineer used the ^ design process to design the supports for this bridge.
The design process can help people solve problems or design creative solutions. Look at the picture of the Ohio River between Rockport, Indiana, and Owensboro, Kentucky. In the past, only one bridge connected these cities. Over time, the bridge got very crowded. In this lesson, youll see how the design process was used to design a solution to this problem.

Active Riding As you read these two pages, underline the sentences that describe steps in the design process.
The next step in the design process is to test and improve the prototype. The engineers gather data about important features of the bridge design, such as how stable it is and how much weight it can support. The team may modify minor aspects of the design based on this data.
If the data show that the prototype has significant flaws, the team must start over again.
They redesign the bridge by making major changes to their initial plan.
Engineers carefully evaluated and tested the safety of the William H. Natcher Bridge. They made sure that builders followed the plans and used the correct materials.
The last step in the design process is to communicate the solution. Bridge inspectors used their findings, or evidence, to write reports. They used mathematical representations, such as graphs, tables, and drawings, to explain that the bridge was safe to open. Engineers could now use this information to make improvements and build bridges in other places!

The prototype helped builders know how wide, tall, and long to make the bridge.

two lines under the main idea.
Technology is always changing. The earliest trains were dragged along grooves in the ground. Today, super-fast trains can travel hundreds of miles an hour. Train tracks have changed over time, too. New technology made tracks of iron. These could carry heavier loads.
Steam locomotives were developed in the early 1800s. They were powered by burning wood or coal that

M heated water to make steam.

Trains could be larger and also travel faster.
These improvements made trains more useful to people. Improvements in technology make trains work better, faster, and more easily.

f Technology and society are connected.	^
Technology affects how people live and what they do. People also affect technology by
inventing new things.
Active Reading As you read these two pages, put brackets [] around the sentence that describes a problem and write P next to it. Underline the sentence that describes the solution and write S next to it.
Trains are an example of technology's connection to society. Trains carry people and cargo long distances. Resources, such as coal, can be carried long distances in a few days. Before trains, people in California may not have been able to get coal easily. People affect new train technology by finding ways for trains to cross high bridges or to tunnel through mountains. New technology helps trains meet people's needs and wants.
Some cities are far away from where coal is found and steel is produced.
Train technology helps resources reach people in
faraway cities.

Although trains through the Swiss Alps are safer than trucks on a road, only small trains can pass. The cars, roads, trains, and tracks are all transportation technologies that help people and goods move around the globe.
This new tunnel is beneath the Swiss Alps. The machine behind the workers is a technology that was used to help drill the tunnel. Large trains will be able to use the tunnel. Now people will be able to save more time traveling between cities.

Essential Question
What Ar^on^
Plant Lif« CydM?
Most plants come from seeds, but how? And where do seeds come from? It’s all part of the life cycle of a plant.
As you read these two pages, find and underline the definitions of life cycle, germinate, flower, reproduce, and cone.
Plants go through many stages in their lives. These stages form a cycle, or pattern, that repeats again and again. The stages an organism, or living thing, goes through during its life is its life cycle.
Most plants come from seeds. A seed germinates when it breaks open and a small plant grows out of it. The plant grows into an adult, which forms flowers in some types of plants. A flower is the part of some plants that enables them to reproduce, or make more plants similar to themselves.
flowers can be colorful, dull, big, or small! Flowers have male parts and female parts that are involved in reproduction.
When a seed is watered, it begins to germinate. A seedling is the tiny new plant that comes out ofthe seed.

Inside each seed is a plant in an early stage of its development. The hard outer covering of the seed protects it. These seeds will grow into large tomato plants.

The seedling grows into an adult plant. The adult tomato plant makes flowers. In flowering plants, seeds are produced in the flowers.
Circle one step in the cycle. Why does
the cycle stop if that step is removed?
The flowers fall off the plant, and the plant makes fruit. The fruit holds the seeds.
Some plants make seeds without flowers. Their seeds form in cones. Cones are the parts of some seed plants where reproduction occurs. Unlike flowers, cones do not develop into fruit. This pinecone has seeds in it that will grow into new pine trees.

g_OD \W®mtes
Big things can come in little packages! Did you know that even the tallest trees started out as small seeds?
Active Reading As you read these two pages, draw two lines
under each main idea.
Plants that make seeds also make pollen. Pollen is a powder-like material involved in plant reproduction. Pollination happens when pollen is moved from the male plant part to the female plant part The environment around a plant helps in pollination. Wind, water, and animals help move pollen from plant to plant. After a plant is pollinated, seeds form in the female parts of the flowers. The part of the flower that surrounds the seeds grows into a fruit. If a flower is not pollinated, it will not form seeds or grow fruit.
Insects and birds drink a sweet liquid called nectar from flowering plants. As they move from plant to plant, they carry pollen with them.

Many seeds have parts that float on the wind. Wind carries these lightweight dandelion seeds to new ground.
Seeds come in many shapes and sizes. When seeds are released from a plant, they are often carried to new areas. Water, wind, and animals carry seeds to new ground. When a seed lands in a good place, it grows into a new plant.

This fruit has seeds in it. If the bird eats the fruit, the seeds will pass through its body. The seeds may be left in a new place. This is one way seeds are spread.

Active Reading As you read this page, draw a circle around a clue word that signals a comparison. Draw a box around a clue word that signals a contrast.
Some plants do not make flowers, cones, or seeds. Instead, they reproduce only with spores. Like seeds, spores are reproductive structures that can grow into new plants.
Ferns are one type of plant that reproduces using only spores. Ferns have leaves called fronds. Each frond has smaller leaves that branch off from the stem.

Moss is another type of plant that
reproduces using only spores. Mosses
are small, soft plants. Groups of moss
often grow together in damp places
without much light Sometimes moss
looks like a green blanket covering
rocks and trees. This blanket is actually
made up of many tiny moss plants.

-
Mosses make spores in little capsules
at the end of stalks. The capsules keep
the spores dry, while the moss remains
damp. When the capsules dry out, they
release the spores into the air These
tiny spores float away to make new
plants where they land-

Active Readinqi As you read these two pages, circle words that show differences between animal lifecycles.
Most animals have male and female parents. But not all animals reproduce, or have young, in the same way. Birds and some fish, reptiles, and amphibians lay eggs. Other animals, such as mammals, give birth to live young. These early stages are part of each animal s life cycle.

A frog is sitting beside a pond， croaking loudly. How did it get there? How has it changed?
Active Reading As you read these two pages, circle words that name stages in the frog's life cycle.
Early in the spring, many frogs wake from hibernation and begin to croak. They are looking for mates. Before long, the pond's water is filled with eggs. Look closely at the photo of a clump of frog eggs. You will see tiny black specks. One day, each speck will grow into a frog as big and green as the one on this page. As a frog develops, its entire appearance changes. Metamorphosis [meUuh«MAWR*fuh«sis] is a major change in the body form of an animal during its life cycle.
Egg mass
Frog eggs are found all stuck together. They look like a cloud of eggs. They are usually in the water of a pond
or marsh.
(Leopard frog )
The leopard frog goes through a series of changes after it hatches as a tadpole.
Tadpole
A tadpole is an immature frog that must live in the water. It hatches from an egg. It has gills and a long tail. It breathes and swims like a fish. It looks very different from its parents.
Life Cycles
How is the life cycle of a frog different from the life cycle of an ostrich?

Young grasshoppers, called nymphs [nimfs], hatch from the eggs.
A nymph looks like an adult grasshopper, but
it doesn’t have wings-


Grasshopper nymph
As a nymph grows, it sheds its outer body covering several times. Each time, its wings become larger and more fully formed.

Measure in Millimeters
A young grasshopper nymph can be 20 millimeters long. Draw a nymph that is 20 millimeters long.
An adult grasshopper can be 45 millimeters long. Draw a grasshopper that is 45 millimeters long.
Diversity
Every living thing is different. Even young who have the same parents are not the same.
Imagine a family of dogs. The mother has brown fur. The father has black fur. What color fur will the puppies have? The answer may be different for every single puppy. Even though they have the same parents, they will get different features from each parent.
All living things share traits, or similar characteristics, with their parents. Hair and eye color are passed on from parents. Even talents and abilities may be passed on from parents to their children.
These puppies have the same parents, but they
all look different. That's because they have received different features from their parents.
Members of the same family often share the same features. Think about families you know. Which features do they share? Which features are different?
Look at the family in the photo on these pages. Do the members of the family look alike? People with the same parents often look alike. But they don't look exactly alike. Diversity_different characteristics— is what makes everyone different from one another.
Comparing Puppies
Circle two puppies. Compare their similarities and differences.

Essential Question
What Ar^ Structural
Adaptations?

Adaptation
Life in the wild isn?t easy. Animals must survive in the environment where they live. Their adaptations help them stay alive.
As you read these two pages, draw a line from the adaptation shown in each picture to the words that describe it.
An adaptation is any trait that helps a living thing survive. Animals that are hunted for food are called prey. Animals that hunt prey are called predators. Predators and prey have adaptations that help them catch food or avoid being eaten. Animals have other kinds of adaptations, too.
What animal is this? It has flat teeth. The flat teeth allow it to grind grass.
The tiger eats animals such as

wild boar and deer The tiger’s sharp teeth help it tear meat.

Look out! It’s a predator! Some adaptations help animals defend themselves without fighting.
Active Reading As you read these two pages, find and underline examples of defense adaptations.
Defense adaptations may attack a predator's sense of sight, smell, taste, touch, or hearing. A bad taste, loud noise, or nasty odor is often enough to make the predator go away.

Aftive Reading As you read these two pages, find and underline the names of two adaptations that involve an animal's appearance.
Some animals can hide without trying. These animals are hidden by their shapes, colors, or patterns. Such disguises are called camouflage [KAM«uh«flazh].
Some harmless animals look a lot like animals that are harmful to predators or that taste bad. Since predators don't know which animal is harmful, neither animal gets eaten. Imitating the look of another animal is called mimicry.
Look at the color of this snow leopard's fur. Look at its spots. Its camouflage helps it blend into the background of snow and rock. This helps it sneak up on prey.

Plants have adaptations that help them survive, too. How? Read more to find out!
Active Reading As you read these two pages, draw a line from the pictures to the words that tell how an adaptation helps a plant.
Plants need water There isn’t much water in a desert, so desert plants are adapted to hold moisture. Desert plants such as cactuses have thick stems that store water. The leaves of desert plants also have a waxy coating that helps prevent water loss. Most desert plants have spines, not leaves. Narrow spines help prevent water vapor from escaping from the plant. The spines also keep animals from eating the plants. Other plants have different adaptations that help them survive.
\
Pitcher plants can’t get the nutrients they need from soil. The plants' pitchers hold water and trap insects for food. The sides are slippery, so when insects fall into the pitchers, they can't get out!
The insects are digested, providing nutrients to the plant. _________________ __________________^

As a child, Miriam Rothschild
collected beetles and caterpillars. Later, she studied fleas and other parasites. Parasites are living things that live on or in other living things. Rothschild studied fleas on rabbits' fur. She discovered how fleas jump. In 1952, she wrote her first book.
It was called Fleas, Flukes and Cuckoos. In 1973, she finished a book about 30,000 different fleas.

Turner showed that ^ honeybees can see ■flower’s color.
Rothschild studied the life cycle of the flea and how it reproduces.
Charles Henry TUrner 1867-1923

Charles Turner was an
entomologist a scientist who
studies insects. He studied many kinds of insects, including ants and honeybees. In 1910, he proved that honeybees can see color. The next year he proved they could also see patterns. Turner found that some ants move in circles toward their home. To honor his work with ants, scientists call this behavior Turner’s circling."

List the terms. As you learn about each one, make notes in the Interactive Glossary.
Many ideas in this lesson are connected because they show comparisons and contrasts—how things are alike and how things are different. Active readers stay focused on comparisons and contrasts by asking themselves. How are these things
alike? How are these things different?
Know It or Learn It?
Eating, sleeping, finding shelter, and moving from place to place. How do animals know what to do?
A<five Reading As you read these two pages, circle words that tell how instinct and learned behaviors are different. Underline examples of each.

A behavior is anything an organism does. Learned behaviors are behaviors that come from watching other animals or through experience. Young animals learn how to behave by watching and copying adults.
There are other behaviors. An instinct is a behavior that an animal knows without learning it. Animals are born with instincts. Behaviors are adaptations that may help an animal survive in its environment.
W ；i|


mother lion teaches her cubs to hunt. Searching for food is an instinct. Knowing how to find and catch food is something cubs learn by copying their parents.



A mother sea turtle buries her eggs in the sand. Most young sea turtles hatch at night. Their instinct is to go toward the brightest area. This instinct helps the hatchlings find the ocean.

Finding Food
Hungry. Cold. Wet. That?s what animals would be without the instinct to find food and shelter.
Adive Reading As you read these two pages, underline details that tell ways animals find food. Circle ways animals find shelter.
Every animal looks for food when it's hungry. It's an instinctual behavior. But actually finding food can be a learned behavior. Some animals learn from watching their parents or other adults. But some animals can learn by themselves, too.
Bears come to this stream to catch salmon. 7"he bears wait for the fish to swim upstream. This is a learned behavior.

HiberwatioM
When the weather turns cold, it is time for many animals to slow down.
As you read these two pages, draw a line under the words that describe what is happening to the animals in the photos.

Animals respond to cold winter weather in different ways. Some animals stay active during winter. They find food or eat food they have hidden. Other animals hibernate, or go into a deep, sleeplike state that helps them survive the cold winter conditions. Normal body activities slow down. The heart beats slowly, and breathing almost stops. Hibernating is an instinctive behavior.
A hibernating animal doesn't use much energy, because its body is barely working. There is enough fat stored in the animal’s body to keep it alive through the winter





This ground squirrel spent the fall eating and gaining weight. It stored up enough energy to survive winter hibernation. T"he squirrel's heart rate and breathing have become slower.

Which animals hibernate? Many animals that eat insects hibernate. These animals include bats, hedgehogs, and hamsters. Insects such as ladybugs and bees also hibernate. So do lizards, snakes, turtles, skunks, badgers, and many more animals.
Many bats like this one hibernate in the winter.
In the spring when the weather warms up, there
is more food for the
bat. It will come out of hibernation.
These snaKes are all hibernating together. When spring arrives, they will leave this den.

Food Preservation
Long ago, people learned to save, or preserve, food. First, people used nature to help them preserve food. Then, people made tools and processes to help. Follow the timeline to see how food preservation has changed over time.
5,000 Years Ago
Salt preserved meat.
Ice kept food from spoiling. People dried meat and fruit.
Heating foods in glass jars kept them fresh. Preserving foods in glass jars and metal cans became common.
In an icebox, air flowed around a block of ice like this one. The cool air kept food fresh
What types of food preservation are still used today? Why are older ways still used even though we have newer tools?

What do sand, salt water, crabs, and seaweed all have in common? You can find them at the beach, of course!
Active Reading As you read these two pages, draw two lines under each main idea.
When you go to the beach, you find lots of living things.
Nonliving things, like sand and salt water, are also part of
the beach. Everything that surrounds a living thing is its
environment. This includes living and nonliving things. Your desk,
teacher, books, and air are all part of your classroom environment.
An ecosystem is all of the living and nonliving things in a place.
In an ecosystem, living things interact with each other and with
the nonliving parts of their environment. Think of bees that use
an old log to build their hive. They gather nectar from flowers to
make honey. A bear eats the honey. These interactions make up a
part of an ecosystem.
Living things in the same ecosystem share resources. Many
of them also share a habitat. A habitat is the
space where a plant or animal lives. A frog's
habitat is a pond A frog’s environment is
everything around the frog.
This crab’s habitat is on the
sand. The crab and sand are
both part of an ecosystem.

Most of Earth is covered with water. There are many different living things below the surface of ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans.
Aftive Reading As you read these two pages, draw a line from the picture to the sentences that describe it.
If you look at a globe, you,ll notice a lot of blue! That blue represents Earth's oceans. The oceans consist of salt water. Animals like sea turtles, whales, and lobsters live in ocean ecosystems. Some ocean animals, like coral, don't look like animals at all. The ocean also has plantlike life forms such as kelp and seaweed.
Rivers, lakes, ponds, and streams are usually fresh water.
Ocean Ecosystem
This huge underwater ecosystem is made by tiny ocean animals called corals.
Clownfish live around sea anemones in their habitat. The clownfish are immune to the anemone’s stings, but animals that might eat the clownfish are not!
158
Fresh water has much less salt than ocean water. Frogs, ducks, and many kinds offish live in fresh water. Alligators are found in freshwater wetlands. Land animals like deer, foxes, and raccoons drink this fresh water.

Rivers carry water to the ocean. This flowing water is an ecosystem made of fresh water.

Lesson Vocabulary
List the terms. As you read, make notes about them in the Interactive Glossary.
Sequence
Many ideas in this lesson are connected by a sequence, or order, that describes the steps in a process. Active readers stay focused on sequence when they mark the transition from one step in a process to another.

Plants need energy to grow and reproduce. Where do you think this energy comes from?
sunlight
Active Reading As you read these pages, draw one line under the source of energy for producers. Draw two lines under the products of photosynthesis that contain energy.
You eat food, such as tomatoes, to get energy. But all green plants, like these tomato plants, must produce, or make, their own food. A producer is a living thing that makes its own food.
The process a plant uses to make food is called photosynthesis [foht«oh«siHN«thuh«sis], During photosynthesis, plants use the energy from sunlight to change water and carbon dioxide [dy.AHKS.yd], a gas in the air, into sugars. A plant uses the sugars as food for growth, or it stores them.
During photosynthesis, plants give off oxygen, a gas that both animals and plants need.




m

Photosynthesis happens in leaves.
The sun’s energy is used to make sugars, which the plant uses or stores.

Animals cannot make their own food. So
where do animals get the energy they need?
As you read, find and underline the definitions
of herbivore, carnivore, and omnivore.
Animals get their energy by eating other living
things. A living thing that eats other living things
is called a consumer. When a rabbit eats

grass, it gets energy from the grass.
A rabbit is a herbivore, an animal that only
eats plants. Some animals get energy by
eating only other animals. These meat
eating animals are called carnivores.
A wolf is a carnivore because it eats
animals like rabbits. Some animals,
such as raccoons, eat both plants and
mi
animals. They are called omnivores.

There are also living things that
get energy from once-living things.
An organism that breaks down
dead organisms for food is called a
decomposer. Earthworms, bacteria

and mushrooms are all examples

of decomposers.

A rabbit eats grass. Later, a wolf eats the
rabbit. Energy moves from producers, like
grass, to consumers, like rabbits and wolves.
Active Reading As you read these two pages, write numbers
next to the pictures to show the correct order of events in a
food chain.
Energy moves between living things in an ecosystem.
A food chain shows the path of food from one living thing to
another. Grass, rabbits, and wolves are part of a food chain. The
rabbits eat the grass, and the wolves eat the rabbits. Energy
moves from the sun to the grass to the rabbit to the wolf
In a food chain, many animals eat other animals. An animal
that hunts other animals for food is a predator. An animal that
is hunted for food is called prey. A shark hunts and eats fish
in a food chain. The shark is a predator. The fish are the prey.
Animals can be both predators and prey in a food chain. Prey
for one animal may be a predator of another animal.

Cause and Effect
Words signaling a cause include
because and if. Words signaling an
effect include so and thus. Active
readers remain alert to cause-and
effect signal words.
In an ecosystem, plants, animals, and other living things share the same environment. But what happens when that environment changes?
Aftive Reading As you read these two pages, draw a circle around
the clue word that signals a cause.
Strong winds have destroyed this forest ecosystem.
In an ecosystem, both living and nonliving things interact. If nonliving things cause the ecosystem to change, the living things will be affected. A powerful storm, for example, may kill plants and animals. Some animals may have to leave to survive. Other animals may stay and have to compete for resources.
Fires cause flame, heat, smoke, and ash. As a result, they can change ecosystems. Fires can be caused by a natural event, like lightning. Fires can also be caused by people. Their effects can be both positive and negative.

NEGATIVE Fires destroy trees and other plants as well as animal habitats.

Plants and animals need water to live. But too much or too little water can have a negative effect on an environment.
Active Reading As you read these two pages, find and underline the definitions of erosion, flood, and drought
Earth's surface is always wearing down and breaking apart. Erosion is when small pieces of rock are carried away by water and sometimes by wind.
When you look at a flowing river, you see more than just moving water. There are also pebbles, sand, and other earth materials. This is erosion. Ocean waves can also cause erosion. Waves hitting a beach carry sand out to sea. As the land wears away, habitats for plants, animals, and people disappear.
Water loosens and moves sand and rock away from the beach. Areas where grass once grew have been washed away by the water.
184
Erosion is not the only way water affects the environment. Both floods and droughts affect the environment A flood is a large amount of water that covers normally dry land. Floods can happen very suddenly.
A drought occurs when it does not rain for a long time. Long droughts force people and animals to look for new places to live. Plants wilt and die.
Finish the Story
Read the start of each story. Look at the photograph. Then finish the story.
Heavy rains this week caused the river to rise higher and higher Nearby fields were flooded.
We have not had rain in many months. We are now in a drought
Water，wind，and other nonliving things can change the environment. But living things can also cause changes.
Active Reading As you read these two pages, draw a star next to what you consider to be
the most important sentence, and be ready to explain why.
Animals and plants can make big changes to their environments. Animals can change the environment when they build shelters. Beavers can cause a new lake to form when they build a dam across a river using trees and sticks. The mounds that termites build add nutrients to the soil. The nutrients help plants grow.
Plants can change their environment, too. One kind of plant may take over all the space in an area. This makes it harder for other plants to survive. It can also make it harder for animals to live there.
Some very small living things change environments by causing disease in plants and animals. Diseases harm plants and make animals sick, and can even kill them.
Beavers change the environment when they cut down trees, make canals.
Termites can build mounds as high as a three-story building!
186
Some algae blooms release poisons. Algae blooms use up oxygen in the water when the algae die and decompose.

When you hike down between hills or mountains, you may end up in a valley.
If you look up and see high cliffs, you may have actually walked down into a canyon!
Active Reading As you read these pages, draw boxes around the names of two landforms that are being compared.
A valley is the low land between mountains or hills. The sides of valleys are not usually steep. Most valleys are formed by rivers. Some valleys are formed by moving ice_
A canyon is a valley with steep sides. Some rivers make canyons as they flow. Over time, soil and loose rock are carried away by the moving water. What is left are tall cliffs that form canyon walls on both sides of the river. The walls of some canyons are very high. The Grand Canyon is about 1,524 meters (5,000 feet) deep from top to bottom!

Climbing High Above
Climbing most hills is easy, if the hill is not too high or steep. Climbing a mountain, however, is another story. The high peaks and jagged edges make it hard to climb!
AdT^Reading As you read, draw one line under a cause.
Draw two lines under an effect.
Mountains are landforms that are much higher than the surrounding land. When two or more pieces of Earth's crust push together, a mountain or mountain range forms. Mountains can also be formed by volcanoes. Some new mountains are growing higher. They are rough and jagged. Older mountains become smaller as they are slowly worn down by wind, water, or ice. As mountains wear down, they also become more rounded
Landforms that are rounded but smaller than mountains are hills.

the Flats
Traveling across plains is much easier than climbing a mountain. The land is so flat, you can ride a bike across it. Plateaus are flat, too——but you?ll have to go up to get to them!
A<Hve Reading As you read, put brackets around clue words that signal when things are being compared or contrasted.
A plain is flat land that spreads out over a long distance. Plains are wide open spaces and may form where there used to be seas. Like a plain, a plateau is flat. However, a plateau is higher than the land around it. A plateau is typically formed when flat land is pushed high up by the movement of Earth’s crust. Plateaus are sometimes found near mountains.

Plains and plateaus are both flat landforms. But a plateau is higher than the 丨and around it. Here you can see that the 丨 plateau is much higher than the plain that surrounds it.
Plains are often used for farming. The Great Plains can be found in the middle of the United States.

Earths surface.
Active Reading As you read these two pages, underline details about what water does to change Earth's surface.
Weathering is the breaking down of rock into smaller pieces. This can happen when tree roots push into the surface of rock. It can happen when animals burrow into the ground.
Weathering is often caused by patterns of freezing and thawing. As winter nears, the weather gets colder. Rain falls into cracks in rock and freezes. As liquid water turns to ice, it expands. This widens the cracks. When the ice melts, or thaws, the rock is weaker. Pieces crumble and fall away. Little by little
the shape of the rock changes. Smaller pieces of rock may
become part of the soil.
Changing seasons cause patterns
of freezing and thawing. This is
one way weathering happens.

Water, wind, and glaciers never stop moving. They carry soil, rocks, and sand along with them. Over time, this movement changes the shape of the land.
Active Reading As you read, circle a word or a phrase that signals a main idea.
In general, erosion happens when soil, rocks, or sand are moved. Wind, water, and glaciers can all cause erosion. It happens everywhere. When waves at a beach wash away sand, that's erosion. When wind blows sand in a desert, that's erosion. When rainfall carries mud into a river, that's erosion.
Glaciers are another cause of erosion. A glacier is a large, thick sheet of moving ice. Glaciers slide along slowly. As they move, many glaciers cut paths through the ground. They pick up pieces of weathered rock, sand, and soil. Glaciers push or carry the rocks and soil as they move.
Sometimes glaciers move enough soil to form a whole island!
Wind and water move sand. This erosion causes one part of the beach to become smaller. Another part of the beach becomes larger when the eroded sand is left there.
Over time, erosion can cause big changes. It has caused this beach to become much smaller than it once was.
When this lighthouse was built, it was far from the cliffs edge. But wind and waves have weathered and eroded the cliff. Now, the lighthouse must be moved to a safer spot.

There is often more than one solution to an engineering problem. To choose the best solution, people make trade-offs.
A trade-off is giving up one feature to make another feature better Read about the trade-offs of two beach erosion solutions.
People can control beach erosion by building a jetty. A jetty begins on a beach and runs into the water It is at a right angle to the shore.

An earthquake is a shaking of Earth's surface that can cause land to rise and fall. Most earthquakes are too weak to be felt, but strong earthquakes can cause a big change to Earth's surface. What causes earthquakes?
Earthquakes happen because of movements in Earth's crust. They occur mostly in places where two pieces of crust meet. Pieces may push together, pull apart, or slide past each other. The map shows places where earthquakes are most likely to happen.

What's as big as a mountain with so much smoke that you can see it from space? Read on to find out!
Aftive Reading As you read these two pages, circle signal words that show sequence.
A volcano is a mountain made of cooled lava, ash, or other materials from eruptions. Like earthquakes, volcanoes are caused by movements of Earth’s crust In some places, one piece of crust slides under another. This causes rock underground to melt. This melted rock, called magma, moves upward. If it reaches an opening, it will erupt onto Earth's surface. The melted rock is then called lava.
As the lava cools, it gets hard. Some volcanoes grow larger with every eruption.
In some volcanoes, lava gently oozes out. Other volcanoes explode! Lava, stone, and ash are thrown from the volcano's opening with tremendous force. Exploding volcanoes can quickly change Earth's surface.

Red-hot melted rock called magma comes up from underground. When it reaches the surface, we call it lava.

In May 1980, Mount St. Helens erupted. First, there was an earthquake. Then, the volcano began to spit out lava and ash. The eruption went on for nine hours. Nearly 379 square kilometers (230 square miles) of forest was buried or blown down.
Before it erupted. Mount St. Helens, in Washington State, was 2,950 meters (9,677 feet) high. Many plants and animals lived on the mountain.
The eruption of Mount St. Helens sent more than one trillion pounds of ash across the United States. Many plants and animals that lived on the mountain died.
Years later, the mountain is more than 305 meters (1,000 feet) lower, but life has returned. The mountain again provides habitats for many different plants and animals.

A little bit of fire, water, or dirt can be very useful. But what if there is too much?
Active	As you read underline the main
idea about each big change. Circle details that tell more about each idea.
A forest fire starts small. It can be sparked by lightning, a bit of lava, or a careless person. People have to act quickly to control forest fires.
Too much rain in too short a period of time can cause a flood. A flood is a change that happens when streams, rivers, or lakes get too full and overflow. Entire towns can be destroyed. Many plants may die, and animals may have to find new homes. Over time, floodwater drains away, dries up, or is absorbed into the ground.

Most of the things you use every
we get these things? How do we use them?
Reading I As you read, underline
the definitions for natural resource and renewable resource.
A natural resource is something that comes from nature that people can use. The air you breathe, and the soil that crops grow in are natural resources. Other natural resources are used to make products you may use. Can you guess which natural resource is used to make paper and pencils?
Paper and pencils are made from trees. Trees are a renewable resource—one that can be replaced easily. We can plant more trees to make more paper and pencils.
The food we eat comes
from nature. Fish that are
caught in the ocean are
sold to people in stores
and markets.
Fish are a renewable
resource. Young fish
replace those that are
caught. Other animals
also eat fish. We have to
be careful not to eat fish
more quickly than they
can be replaced

Water is an important
resource. We drink water
and also use it for many
other things. We can use
falling water to produce
energy. If we clean water.
we can use it again.
Some natural resources
are used to make reusable
products. You can use this
plastic water bottle over
and over again.
What Resources Do You Use?

Not all natural resources are renewable. Some natural
resources will eventually be used up and be gone.

that compares three nonrenewable resources.


Many resources are found underground. People dig for copper at this mine. Oil, coal, and natural gas can also be found underground.

A nonrenewable resource is a natural resource that
can be used up. Oil, coal, and natural gas are nonrenewable resources we use to produce different kinds of energy, including electricity. They are fossil fuels—fuels that form over many years from the remains of once organisms.
How can we make sure these resources don't disappear
too quickly? We have to conserve them. Conservation
is saving resources by using them wisely. What are some
ways that you can use nonrenewable resources wisely? You
can start by turning off lights when you don't need them

Look around the room. Everything you see comes from natural resources. Books, shelves, desks, toys_they're all made from Earth materials.
Even the materials that make up a computer come from Earth. The outside and the inside of a computer are both made from natural resources. Glass computer screens are made from sand. The plastic parts can be produced from oil. To operate, computers also need electricity from fossil fuels.
We also depend upon renewable resources. Imagine you are standing outside. You feel the sun and the wind. These are two important renewable sources of energy.
Solar cells like the ones in these solar panels turn renewable energy into energy we can use.
Many of the clothes we wear are made from natural materials such as cotton. Cotton comes from a plant.

What's that smell? Pollution can make the air9 land, and water smell awful. Some of the ways we use natural resources can be harmful.

Active Readiii? As you read this page, underline
all the causes of pollution.


Smoke from this factory mixes with the air. This makes the air harmful to breathe.
What is pollution? Pollution is harmful substances in the environment. Smoke in the air is pollution. So are chemicals in water and garbage on land.
What causes pollution? Pollution often results from people using natural resources. Burning fossil fuels, such as gasoline in cars and coal for energy, can cause air pollution. Land pollution is caused when people don't put trash where it belongs. When chemicals and wastes get into water, they cause water pollution.

People need natural resources to survive5 but we have to use them responsibly.
You can help by remembering the “3 Rs”一reduce^ reuse, and recycle.
Adive Reading As you read this page, underline ways to
reduce, reuse, and recycle.
To reduce means to use less of something. There are
many ways to use fewer natural resources. You can
use both sides of a piece of paper, for example. To
/
conserve fossil fuels, you could ride a bike instead
of riding in a car. And you could turn off the
lights when you leave a room.
When you reuse something, you use
it again. You can take a reusable bag
to the grocery store. And you
can use a refillable water bottle.
When you recycle something,
it is made into a new product.
Glass, aluminum cans, paper,
plastic bottles, and yard waste
can all be recycled. Even the oil
from cars can be recycled!
Recycling keeps billions of
pounds of material from
being thrown in the trash.

Soil is not j收 Dit*t
Soil is important. Why? Most plants need soil to grow. Without plants, there would be no food for animals or people.
Active Reading As you read these two pages, draw a star next to what you think is the most important sentence. Be ready to explain why you think so.
When you are in a forest or garden, or even a parking lot, what is under your feet? Below the sticks, rocks, plants, and pavement, there is soil. Soil is a mixture of water, air, tiny pieces of rock, and humus. Humus is a rich mixture of the decomposed, or broken down, remains of plants and animals.
There are many kinds of soil. Soil can be black, red, brown, gray, and even white. Soil can be moist or dry. It can contain different kinds of minerals—even gold!
Soil is a mixture of decomposing plants and animals, small bits of rock, air, and water
266
Some kinds of soil are better for growing plants than other kinds. Soil that is very good for plants is fertile. It can take hundreds or even thousands of years to form. Because soil is such an important natural resource, it must be conserved.

The dead leaves on this forest floor will decompose and become part of the soil.
Farmers must take
care of the soil so it
will remain fertile.
Hou/ Does !
Soil Form?
If you dig deep into the soil, you can see that soil has different layers.
Active Reading As you read these two pages, draw one line under a cause. Draw two lines under the effect.
The top layer of soil is called topsoil. It is the most fertile soil layer. Plants grow in the topsoil. Topsoil is fertile because it contains humus. Humus makes the soil darker.
The layer beneath topsoil is called subsoil. Subsoil does not have a lot of humus, but it does have small pieces of rock. If you dig deep enough into the soil, you will reach solid rock.
This is bedrock.
How does soil form? It forms from bedrock. When bedrock is at Earth’s surface, it breaks down by weathering. Rain, wind, and other things weather bedrock, so big pieces of rock get smaller and smaller. Eventually, bedrock is broken into small bits of rock These mix with air, water, and humus to form soil.

of soil. Plants and animals can be found above the soil and inside the soil, too.
%
Topsoil is the layer of soil closest to Earth’s surface. Topsoil is where most plants grow. Topsoil is fertile because it contains humus. It also contains small bits of weathered bedrock.



Subsoil is one or more layers of soil that lie between the topsoil and bedrock. Subsoil contains slightly larger pieces of rock than topsoil and little or no humus.

Types
of
Soil
There are more than 70,000 kinds of
soil in the United States alone! What makes them different from one another?
| Active Reading As you read these two pages, draw boxes around the names of things that are being contrasted.
As you know, soil contains humus as well as water, air, and bits of rock. One way to distinguish among soils is by the sizes of their particles.
Tiny particles of rock that you can see with just your eyes are called sand. Silt is tiny particles of rock that are difficult to see with only your eyes. Particles of rock that are even smaller than silt are called clay.
The amounts of sand, silt, and clay in soil give it texture. Texture is how the soil feels in your hands.
Soil with more sand feels rough, while soil with more clay feels smooth. Soils can be made up of different minerals, depending on the area where the soils formed. A soil's color also depends on where it formed.
Soils that contain a lot of clay particles are fertile but heavy and sticky. They hold moisture well. They get very cold in winter, but dry out and get hard in the summer.

t f
Sandy soils let water pass through easily. They dry out quickly. Sandy soils are usually light and easy to dig.
-



Soils that are mostly silt feel slippery when they are wet. They hold moisture for a long time. They also hold nutrients very well.
Why does water pass through sandy soils more quickly than through soils that contain mostly clay or silt?
271
Plants
Need
Soil
What do plants get from soil? They get nutrients, water, and a place to live.
Active Reading As you read these two pages, find and underline the definition of nutrients.
Plants need water and light to grow. They also need nutrients. Nutrients are substances that plants take in from the soil through their roots to help them live and grow.
The best kind of soil for most plants is called loam. Loam has a balance of silt, sand, and clay. It is rich in nutrients and humus, it stays moist, and it is easy to dig. Some plants, though, grow better in other types of soil.
272
Which Soil Matches the Plant?
Look at the images above. What can you conclude about the soil requirements of these plants?
In which of these soils do most types of cactus grow? What does this tell you about cactuses?
Don?t throw away that banana peel! You can use fruit peels and other kitchen scraps to help plants grow.
Active Reading As you read these two pages, find and
underline two facts about compost.
Compost is humus that you make yourself Pile plant parts, such as dried leaves and grass, into a big container. Then add scraps of fruits and vegetables. Tiny organisms too small to see will decompose the scraps to make humus. Spread compost on your plants so they will grow quickly and stay healthy.
Compost does more than help plants in your garden. Making compost means that you don't throw away as much garbage. When people throw away less garbage, that’s good for everyone!

Noah Idechong grew up in a small fishing village on the island nation of Palau. Palauan children are taught to take special care of the ocean. The ocean provides their families with food. Idechong works to conserve ocean life. Boats can damage coral on the coast. When the coral dies, many fish leave, and the fish populations get smaller. Idechong helps make rules to protect the coastal environment.

Lena Qiying Ma is a soil scientist. She studies how some plants take in arsenic [AR#suh«nik]. Arsenic is used as a poison to keep weeds away from crops. During her research, Ma found a fern growing in an industrial site. It was green even though the soil was polluted with arsenic. Ma discovered that ferns remove arsenic from soil.
She studies how the fern can be used to clean up pollution in soil and groundwater.

Problems and Fixes
In the past, many soft drinks came in glass bottles. Today, most soft drinks come in aluminum cans. Aluminum cans are lighter than glass and do not break. But aluminum is a nonrenewable resource.
Recycling technology helps solve this problem.
From a recycling bin, used cans go to recycling centers.
Machines crush the cans. The flat cans form blocks of aluminum.
The blocks are melted and rolled into thin sheets-Then the aluminum is made into new cans and other items. Aluminum can be recycled over and over.
Solve a Problem
Technology can solve problems. It can also cause problems. Today, millions of products are made from plastic, including water bottles, pens, toys, and bags. But plastic is made from fossil fuels, which are nonrenewable resources. Also, plastic does not break down easily.
Cars help people get around.But they cause air pollution.

Water Movei—
Ml ^r®ujiidi
If you were in a spaceship looking down at Earth, you would see that most of Earth is covered by water.
AcfiygiRgaginq As you read this page, find and underline two examples of fresh water.
Almost all water on Earth is in the oceans. Ocean water is salt water, which contains salt, of course! It is too salty for us to drink. However, many life forms live in salt water
Only a tiny part of Earth’s water is fresh water. Fresh water has very little salt in it. We need fresh water to drink. Many plants and animals need fresh water, too. Rivers and lakes contain fresh water, but most of Earth's fresh water is frozen!
Icebergs are made of fresh water. Most of Earth’s fresh water is frozen in glaciers at the South Pole. That's why it's important to conserve the fresh water that is not frozen.

ttf^Wateir
Water is a kind of matter. It can exist as a solid, a liquid, or a gas.
ActiygjRMdiinq When things are contrasted, you find out ways they are different. Draw boxes around three things that are being contrasted
Ice is solid water. Icebergs are small chunks of ice in the ocean. Glaciers are huge blocks of ice. Some glaciers are as big as whole countries! Most of Earth's fresh water is ice.
Ice melts to make liquid water. Liquid water is found in the ocean, rivers, streams, ponds, and even underground When water exists as a gas, it is called water vapor. Water vapor is in the air we breathe. You cannot see water vapor.
Water can exist as a solid, a liquid, or a gas.
States of Water

Water vapor
Air is a mixture of gases. One of these gases is water vapor You can't see water vapor. The space between the clouds has water vapor in it.
Liquid water
Liquid water fills the ocean, lakes, and streams. Clouds are made of small droplets of liquid water. Fog, mist, and falling rain are also liquid water.

Ice
This glacier is an example of ice. Earth’s solid water Glaciers cover land that is close to the North Pole and the South Pole. They also cover some mountains.

Where Is the Water?
1. Where can you find water vapor in nature?
2. Where can you find liquid water in nature?
3.	Where can you find solid water in nature?


293
Chan gin gi States
Water changes state. For example，liquid water can change to ice and to water vapor. What causes water to change state?
Active Reading find sentences that contrast two things. Draw a line under each sentence.
Water changes state when it is heated or cooled. When enough heat is added to ice, it becomes liquid water. This change of state is called melting. The reverse of melting is freezing.
When liquid water gains enough heat, it evaporates to become water vapor. Evaporation is the change of state from a liquid to a gas.
When water vapor loses enough heat, it changes back to liquid water. The change of state from a gas to a liquid is called condensation. Condensation and evaporation are opposite processes.
For water vapor to condense, it needs something to condense on. Even the drops of water in clouds have condensed on tiny pieces of dust.

The wet footprints shown here will change to water vapor as they are heated by the sun's energy.

The Wattr
Cpilcy
Water is always moving. In fact, water moves continuously from Earth’s surface to the atmosphere and back to Earth.
Adive Reading A cause tells why something happens. Draw one line under each cause.
The sun heats the ocean. This causes water to evaporate and become water vapor. The water vapor mixes with other gases and moves high up in the air.
As the water vapor rises, it cools. If it loses enough heat energy, it condenses to form water droplets in clouds. This water can fall back to Earth as precipitation. Precipitation can be rain, sleet, snow, or hail. The type of precipitation that falls depends on the temperature of the air around it.
After water falls, it moves across land. Some water flows underground. This is groundwater. Groundwater and surface water flow back to the ocean. More water in the ocean is heated and evaporates again. This never-ending movement of water between Earth's surface and the air is called the water cycle.
296

As water vapor rises and cools, it
condenses to form clouds. The tiny
water droplets in the clouds bump into
each other to make larger droplets.




When the droplets
become too heavy
to stay up in the air.
they fall to Earth as
precipitation.
Answer Key： 1. Water can be a solid called ice. Ice can change to become liquid water when it is warmed. 2. Liquid water is often just called water. Liquid water can change to ice or water vapor. 3. Water can be a gas called water vapor. Water vapor can change to form liquid water when it loses energy.

The sun^s energy causes the water cycle. It also affects the weather. As the sun heats Earth, temperatures change. Changing temperatures mean changing weather!
Active Reading As you read these two pages, underline lesson vocabulary each time it is used.
Earth is surrounded by a layer of gases. This layer of gases is Earth s atmosphere. Oxygen is one of the gases in Earth's atmosphere. Most living things need oxygen to survive. Water vapor is another type of gas in Earth's atmosphere.
Conditions in the atmosphere can change. Weather is the condition of the atmosphere at any one place and time. If the atmosphere over your school is warm and dry in the morning, your weather is warm and dry. But the atmosphere, and your weather could change. The weather could be cool and rainy by the afternoon.
This cloud is a cumulonimbus
[kyoo«myuh«loh«NiM«buhs] cloud. These clouds are often tall and have a flat top. They sometimes look like mushrooms and often produce thunderstorms.
Types of Clouds
There are many types of clouds. Each type of cloud has a different shape. The type of clouds in the sky can tell you what kind of weather may be coming.
Cirrus [siR«uhs] clouds are thin and feathery. Cirrus clouds form high up in the atmosphere, where temperatures are cold. They are often a sign that the weather is about to change.

It’s okay to say，“It’s cold and rainy outside.” But when we need to know exactly what the weather is, we must measure it.
Active Reading As you read this page, turn the heading into a question in your mind and circle sentences that answer the question.
Temperature is a measure of how hot or cold something is. The tool we use to measure temperature is a thermometer.
Air temperature is measured in degrees Celsius (°C) or degrees Fahrenheit (°F).
The temperature of the atmosphere affects the kind of precipitation that falls. Above 0 °C rain is likely. Below 0 °Cf the air is so cold that rain, sleet, or snow may fall.
Sometimes it rains so much that it’s hard to see anything. A rain gauge is a tool that collects rain and shows how much has fallen.
If the wind is blowing, we can tell the direction it's coming from with a wind vane. A wind meter tells how fast the wind is blowing.
306
Thermometer
A thermometer is a tube
filled with a liquid. When
the air gets hotter, the
liquid moves up the tube.
When the air gets cooler.
the liquid moves down
the tube. To find the
temperature, read the
number next to the top

Being Ready For
Weather affects us in many ways. We have to consider weather when we choose what to wear, what items to use, and where to go.
To stay safe and comfortable, we wear clothing that's right for the weather. When it’s raining, we stay dry with a raincoat, boots, and umbrella.
The weather also affects the activities we can do. We can swim when it s warm. We can ski only when it s cold enough for snow.
To help us, scientists try to predict the weather. When we know what kind of weather is coming, we can make plans to dress right, and we can choose the right kinds of activities.

Weather can be severe and even dangerous. Hurricanes, thunderstorms，tornadoes，and blizzards are examples of severe weather.
and underline examples of severe weather.
A hurricane is a tropical storm with winds of 119 kilometers (74 miles) per hour or more. Hurricanes form over warm ocean water. They become slow, large storms soon after they reach land. Hurricanes can blow trees over and cause large areas of flooding.
Thunderstorms are strong storms that have thunder and lightning. Often there is heavy rain and strong wind, too.
Tornadoes are small, spinning columns of very strong wind.
A blizzard is a snowstorm with strong wind and a very low temperature.
To be safe in severe weather, follow directions from a teacher, parent, or other adult who knows what to do.
Tornado
Tornadoes are most common in states, such as Texas and Kansas, where there are large plains. Tornado winds are so strong that they can rip a tree out of the ground and move a car through the air_

Blizzard
During blizzards, the snow blows so fast it is hard to see through. Being out in a blizzard is cold and dangerous!
Thunderstorm
Lightning is a flash of electricity that happens during a thunderstorm. Lightning can kill people Always stay indoors during a thunderstorm.

Hurricane
Since hurricanes form over warm ocean waters, they lose power quickly when they move over land. But hurricanes can still do a lot of damage when they reach land

Label each picture to show all four parts of the day-night cycle. Number the parts to show the correct sequence.
Picture a line going through Earth from the North Pole to the South Pole. This imaginary line is Earth's
Like a wheel on a bike. Earth rotates, or turns, on its axis. Earths
[ro®TAY®shuhn] causes the cycle of day and
night. One full rotation takes 24 hours, or one full day.
From one sunrise to the next, we spin through the parts of a day—morning, daytime, evening, and night The day-night cycle happens over and over again. Think about the things you do in each part of this cycle. When do you wake up? Eat? Sleep? People follow a cycle, too!
Reasons
for seasons
Winter, spring, summer, fall. Like day and night, the seasons make a cycle.
As you read these two pages, find and underline the definition of revolution.
As Earth turns on its axis, it also moves around the sun.
revolution
Each complete trip of Earth around the sun is one [reh*vuhnoo.shuhn]_ Each revolution takes about 365 days, or
one year.
The seasons change as Earth moves around the sun. The diagram shows that Earth is tilted on its axis. The part of Earth that points toward the sun gets more direct sunlight. The part that points away from the sun gets less. As Earth moves around the sun, the part that gets more direct sunlight changes. The part with the most direct sunlight has summer. The part with the least direct sunlight has winter. During fall and spring, neither the top nor the bottom half of Earth is tilted toward or away from the sun.
• •
Look at the image labeled summer.
When the North Pole is pointing
toward the sun, people who live
north of the equator—in the Northern
Hemisphere—have summer. Those in the
Southern Hemisphere have winter
What Season Is It?
Label the images with the correct season.
What is winter like for kids in the United States? That depends on where you live!
In Phoenix, Arizona, winter temperatures are usually in the 60s or 70s. In Portland, Oregon, they are usually in the 40s or 50s. But someone in Madison, Wisconsin, would be used to temperatures in the 20s or 30s!
In the Northeast, a big snowstorm can bring everything to a stop!

Phases of the Moon
On some nights you see a round moon.
On other nights you see a sliver of moon.
Sometimes you see no moon at all. Why?
number the moon phases to show their sequence. Begin with the new moon. Write your answers in the caption boxes.
Does moonlight really come from the moon? No! The moon doesn't produce its own light. It reflects light from the sun. This reflected light is what we see from Earth. At any time, half of the moon is lit by the sun.
As the moon revolves around Earth, different amounts of its lit side can be seen. This is what causes the different shapes, or phases, of the moon. Eight moon phases make up one cycle. A full cycle happens in about one month. Then the cycle repeats.
The Big Four Phases
The four main moon phases are new moon, full moon, and both quarter moons. Label the missing phase below. Then fill in the dark part of the moon. Use the diagram at right to help you.

Both pictures show the same beach.
Why is the water so low in one picture and so high in the other? It's because of tides.
Active Reading As you read these two pages, draw boxes around the names of the two things that are being compared.
Tides are changes in the height of ocean water. The pull of the moon's gravity causes ocean tides. When the moon is above an ocean, it causes high tide on that part of Earth and on the opposite side, too.
In the parts of the ocean between the two areas of high tide the water level is lower. At those places, a low tide occurs.
Where have all the people gone? They didn’t want to get wet! They left before it was high tide.
At most beaches, there are high tides and low tides every day. The tides make a cycle. How do you know it is high tide here now? Before, we saw people walking on the beach. Now, the beach is covered with water!
Pattern of Tides
On the lines below, tell where the moon might have been when the picture on this page was taken.
In the space below, draw what the image on this page will look like next as it continues its cycle.

Katherine Johnson 1918-
Katherine Johnson was a ' human computer ^ at NASA. With her knowledge of math, she helped astronauts travel into space. Johnson computed the path the spacecrafts would take. In 1961 she figured out the flight path for the first American in space, Alan Shepard. By 1962, NASA was using real computers for John Glenn s orbits around
Earth. But they still called on Johnson to check the computers’ numbers.
In 1969Johnson worked to help the Apollo 11 spacecraft travel into space. During this trip, Neil Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon.

Amanda Nahm is a planetary scientist. She studies the surfaces of planets and the moon. When a meteoroid hits the surface of a planet or moon, it forms a crater, or hole- The craters on the moon have been there for billions of years. Larger craters often have cracks, or faults, that form around them. By
studying these craters and faults, Nahm can learn about the history of the moon s formation.

Matter is anything that takes up space. Your science book takes up more space than your pencil does. Did you know that no two things can take up the same space?
You describe matter by naming its physical properties. A physical property is a characteristic of matter that you can observe or measure directly. Look in the boxes to learn about some properties of matter.

How Much
Why is it so difficult to lift a bucket full of water? Would it be easier to carry the water in smaller containers instead?
As you read these two pages, find and underline the definition of mass. Then circle the name of the tool we use to measure mass.

A
Mass is the amount of matter an object has. Mass is also a measure of how hard it is to move an object. The more mass an object has, the harder it is to move the object.
How can you measure the mass of sand, water, or other materials in a bucket? Check out the next page.

-
We use a pan balance to measure mass. The pan balance measures mass in grams (g). How can you measure the mass of the contents of a bucket? To find the mass, you have to use math.
Find the mass of the container alone.

• What is a metallurgist?
A metallurgist is a scientist who works with metals. Iron, aluminum, gold, and copper are just some of these metals. They also combine different metals to make a new metal.
Why do they combine different metals?
Am Metals may have different weights, strengths, and hardnesses. They combine metals to change their properties. The new metal may be stronger, harder, or a different color.
How do they use the properties of metals in their work?
Am They look at the properties of metals and how metals can be used. Iron is strong. Mixed with other materials it becomes steel. Steel is a hard and strong metal. Copper can conduct electricity. It's a good metal to use for electrical wires.

Signal Words：
Cause and Effect
Signal words show connections between ideas. Words signaling a cause include because and if. Words signaling an effect include so and thus. Active readers remember what they read because they are alert to signal words that identify causes and effects.
What a party! You can eat a piece of solid cake, drink a cold liquid, or play with a gas-filled balloon.
Active Reading As you read these two pages, draw circles around the names of the three states of matter that are being compared.
There are three common states of matter. They are solid, liquid, and gas. Water can be found in all three states A solid is matter that takes up a definite amount of space. A solid also has a definite shape. Your science book is a solid. Ice is also a solid.
A liquid is matter that also takes up a definite amount of space, but it does not have a definite shape. Liquids take the shape of their containers. Drinking water is a liquid.
A gas is matter that does not take up a definite amount of space and does not have a definite shape. The air around you is a gas.

All the pictures show water at a temperature lower than 0 degrees Celsius (0 °C) or 32 degrees Fahrenheit (32 °F). How do we know this? If liquid water cools to that temperature, it freezes. Below that temperature, water exists as a solid—ice. Freezing is the change of state from a liquid to a solid.

Liquid water can change to a gas without boiling. Look at the drawings of a puddle. What changes do you see?
Water can
evaporate at temperatures below 100°C.

Active Reading As you read these two pages,
draw a line under each main idea.
Liquid water does not have to boil to become a gas. When you sweat on a hot day, the water on your skin disappears. The liquid water turns into a gas. This is called evaporation [ee*vap*uh*RAY*shuhn]. Water can evaporate from other places, such as a puddle.


The sun’s heat makes the water in the puddle change to water vapor, which goes into the air.

The puddle gets smaller as the water disappears. Most of the liquid water has changed to a gas.

A gas can change back to a liquid. This is called condensation [kahn*duhn*sAY*shuhn]. Water vapor condenses as it cools and loses energy. Water vapor in the air condenses on a cold car window.
The outside of a cold soft drink can becomes wet on a hot day. The grass on a cool morning may have dew on it. These are all condensation.

A change to matter can be either physical or chemical. In physical changes，substances keep their identity. No new matter is formed.
As you read these two pages, underline examples of physical changes.
A firefighter folds a piece of paper in half. She tears along the fold. Then she cuts out the shape of a truck.
Two physical properties have changed： size and shape. The cut-out truck is still paper. The scraps are still paper. In a physical change, the kind of matter stays the same. Folding, tearing, and cutting are all

[L©WQOS Help You TO
Levers are simple machines. They are often used to lift things. You use levers all the time without realizing it. How do they work?
As you read these two pages, find and underline the definitions of lever and fulcrum.
A lever is a bar that pivots, or turns, on a fixed point. A fixed point is a point that doesn't move. The fixed point on a lever is called the fulcrum [FUHL^kruhm]. The load—what you are
is on one end of the lever. As you move the other end of the lever, the lever moves the load.
A fork is one kind of lever. The boy’s thumb is the fulcrum. As he lowers his hand, the fork lifts the
Draw a lever. Label the fulcrum,
A seesaw is a lever. Its fulcrum is in the the load, and the applied force, middle. The fulcrum is the object on which the seesaw sits. If your friend sits on one end of a seesaw, where would you apply force to lift her? You would sit on the other end of the seesaw.
Rakes and brooms are another type of lever. Your hands move when you rake leaves or sweep a floor, but the leaves or dirt—the load—moves farther than your hands do. This makes your job easier.
On a seesaw, you may be a load or a force. When you are coming down, your weight is the applied force.
It presses down on one end of the

side goes up. Then you trade. You
are the load being lifted, and your
partner's weight is the force.
Some simple machines use circular motion to make work easier.
ActivgjRMdihqi As you read these two pages
/
underline the phrases that describe the effect of turning each wheel-and-axle.
A wheel應and庸axle is made up of a wheel
and an axle that are connected so that they turn together. A wheel-and-axle uses a circular motion to increase force. If you turn the wheel, the axle turns with greater force.
r
Turning the handlebar is like turning the purple wheel. The connected axle turns to steer the front bicycle wheel.
Look at the picture of the bicycle. The handlebars are connected to a shaft. Together, these act as a wheel-and-axle. When you turn the handlebars, the shaft, or axle, turns with it. Since the axle is connected to the front wheel, the wheel also turns. In this way, you can steer without having to turn the wheel from side to side with your hands.
The wheels and axles at the bottom of the bicycle are not true wheel-arid-axles. These wheels turn on their axles. The axles do not turn with the wheels.
Another Wheel-and-Axle
A doorknob is another example of a wheel-and-axle. When you turn the knob, the axle turns, too. As it does, it pulls back the catch, and the door opens. Which part of the doorknob is the wheel?

A pencil sharpener has a wheel-and-axle. When you turn the crank, the axle carries the movement to the sharpener. It turns to sharpen the pencil.
Going up! Coming down! You can use a simple machine，like a pulley，to lift a load straight up into the air.
Active Readinq As you read these two
pages, find and underline the definition of pulley.
A pulley is a wheel with a rope, cord, or chain around it. One end of the rope hangs on each side of the pulley.
You can pull from the side, like the girls in the tree house.
The pulley is attached to the tree house. One end of the rope is in the tree house.
The other end is attached to the basket. By pulling on the free end of the rope, the girls in the tree house raise the basket to their level.
410

You can also pull from below, like the girl in the sailboat. She doesn't have to climb to the top of the pole to raise the sail. Instead, she simply pulls down on the rope. In both of these examples, the pulley changes the direction of the force that is applied to the rope.
A pulley lets you stay in one place and still use your force. It lets you pull up something that is too far down to reach, like the basket on the ground. And it lets you pull up something to a point too high to reach, like the sail.
The pulley is attached to the top of the mast of the sailboat. It can be used to raise and lower the sail. Look around your school. Check the windows and the gym. Where can you find pulleys?

Building with Cranes
All cranes have levers and pulleys. Cranes lift and lower heavy loads. People use cranes to make tall buildings.
Follow the timeline to see how cranes have changed

over time.
m 2,500 Years Ago
Cranes were first used in ancient Greece. They were used to build huge marble temples.
Steam engines were added to cranes. These cranes could move more easily and lift heavier loads.
Cranes were made out of steel. They had gas or electric engines and could lift
much heavier loads.

Compare and Contrast
Review the cranes pictured and discussed in the timeline. Then answer the questions below.
i
Cranes lift beams to make the frame of a skyscraper.

2010
Today, skyscrapers are made using tower cranes. These giant cranes are made of steel. They can lift the heaviest loads. They are put together by smaller cranes, and the giant cranes can't move from place to place.

Simple machines are parts of tools we use every day. A ramp? It?s a simple machine.
A knife? It’s another kind of simple machine. How do these simple machines work?
Active Reading As you read these two pages, find and underline the definitions of inclined plane and wedge.
A plane is a flat object, such as a board. An inclined plane is a plane that is slanted, so that one end is higher than the other. This makes it easier to lift a load. Instead of lifting the load straight up all at once, you push or pull it up the inclined plane, little by little. This spreads the work over a distance. Because of this, you are able to use less force.
_
i wheel

It takes longer to roll a wheelchair up a ramp than to lift it. But lifting a wheelchair takes more effort. Raising the wheelchair with the ramp takes less effort because you apply a smaller force over a greater distance. You do the same amount of work, but a the work is easier.	邏
iii
lined Plane

A wedge is two inclined planes placed back to back. One edge is sharp and pointed. The other is wide and flat. If you apply force to the flat edge, the pointed edge can split one thing into two things.
A knife is a wedge. The sharp edge of the knife opens a tiny crack. The inclined planes on either side push outward, widening the crack and separating the pieces as the wedge moves downward. The sharper the knife, the less effort is needed to get the work done.
EMhe Matli!
Calculate Force

An inclined plane that is 4 meters long and 2 meters high reduces the force needed to lift an object by one half A person must use 90 units of force to lift an object straight up_ How much force must the person use to push the object up this inclined plane?

A wheel-and-axle uses circular motion to do work, but so does another simple
machine——the screw.
Active Rwdinqi As you read these two pages, draw a
box around each word that signals a comparison.
A screwdriver is a wheel-and-axle. It uses circular motion to make work easier. The tip of the screwdriver fits into the slot at the top of a screw.
A screw is an inclined plane wrapped around a shaft or a cylinder. When you turn the screwdriver's handle, its shaft works like an axle to turn the screw. A screwdriver doesn't just turn the screw. Like other wheel-and-axles, the screwdriver takes your effort and increases that effort as it turns the screw.
As the screwdriver turns the screw, the inclined plane on the screw pulls it into the wood. The threads also make it hard to pull the screw out of the wood.

Unlike a nail, which goes straight into the wood, a screw moves around and around as it goes in. As a result, it takes longer to insert a screw into the wood than it does a nail. But you use less force to get the screw into the wood.
The closer together the threads are, the easier it is to turn the screw.
This man is using an ice auger [Aw.ger], As he turns the handle, the auger pulls the ice beneath it up to the surface. The ice is the load. As it moves up, a hole is made in the ice.

What Does a Screw Do?
Circle the screw in each picture. How does the screw help to do work?

A compound machine is a machine made up of two or more simple machines. Garden clippers are a compound machine. Bicycles are also compound machines. The handlebars are not the only wheel-and-axle on a bicycle. When you push down on the pedals, a wheel-and axle pulls the chain. This moves the bicycle forward.
