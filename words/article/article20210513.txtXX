People communicate with the internet all the time. They use wireless devices. These devices pull information from data centers. These centers hold computers. The computers store data, or information. This might include videos or emails.

Data moves between devices and data centers. It uses Wi-Fi or mobile networks to move. These networks let computers communicate with each other. They do not need wires to connect them. They use radio waves. These waves are invisible. They can travel through space. They are used for many types of communication. They carry data. They also carry radio and television signals.

Huge towers send radio waves. They use a lot of energy. This energy comes from burning fuels. Examples include oil and coal. But burning fuels releases gases like carbon dioxide. These gases heat up the atmosphere. This is a blanket of gases. It surrounds the planet. Releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide leads to warmer temperatures over time.

So using these networks affects the environment. But there is a new mobile network. It is called 5G. It might help save energy.

Hertz And Gigahertz

5G is similar to other networks. It also uses radio waves. But they work at a higher frequency. Frequency is how many waves pass one point during a period of time. Hertz is the name of the unit that measures frequency. 5G stands for 5 gigahertz. One gigahertz is equal to one billion hertz.

The image shows a low frequency wave with longer wavelengths on top and a high frequency wave with shorter wavelengths on the bottom.Zoom-in
Image 2. Waves with higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths. These waves are faster and use less energy. Graphic: Newsela staff
Higher frequency radio waves are faster. They also use less energy. Let us look at an example. A cellular network has antennas. They send and pick up radio waves. The antennas stick out from the top of a tall tower. They cover a circle of several miles. This area is known as a cell.

5G uses more cells. But they are smaller. The 5G antennas reach just 500 meters. That is 1,640 feet. Let us say you add up all the small cells covering the same area as one large one. The small cells would use less power.

Think about an event in a sports arena. Lots of people need the network. A small cell can support them all. But what if no event is happening? Then the cell can shut down. So, small cells make the network smarter.

Faster Uploads And Downloads

There is another benefit to using 5G. It packs more data into a smaller space. So 5G can send more data in the same time. It can arrive 600 times faster. It also needs less energy to send it. So using 5G might save time and energy.

But there is a catch. Right now, only newer phones can use 5G. And it is not available in many parts of the country. Experts say that 5G should become more widespread. This could happen in the next few years.

Wildfires are in full swing this summer. They have been burning in California. There have been big fires in Europe. Scientists are studying these fires. They want to understand why they are so hard to stop.

People are causing some of the problems. They do not take care of the forests. Builders put houses there. These homes are in danger when fires start.

Climate change is a growing problem, too. Scientists think that the Earth is getting warmer. This is because people are using too much fuel. Many things, such as cars, need fuel in order to work.

Burning fuel creates gases. These gases make the world hotter. Scientists call this climate change. Scientists think climate change is making fires worse.

Hot And Dry Weather

Firefighters call it "fire weather." It is hot and dry. It is also windy. This kind of weather helps fires burn.

Many areas are getting hotter. They are also getting drier. Wildfires in those places are getting worse.

Dead Plants Burn Easily

A drier climate kills many trees and plants. Dead plants burn more easily.

New Plants That Catch Fire Easily

What replaces the dead plants? New kinds of plants. These plants like dry weather. But they catch fire easily.

Fire Season Can Last All Year

Fire season is when most fires happen. But the hot and dry weather is making them longer. California's fire season used to be shorter. It was in the summer. Now fire season lasts all year.

Hotter, Faster-Moving Fires

Climate change is making Earth hotter. Some places are also getting drier. These changes affect how fires act. They burn faster and hotter. They are harder to fight.

Climate change is changing the world. It is causing higher temperatures. Some places are getting less rain. More wildfires are one of the results.

Pests Spreading

Winters are getting warmer. This change lets pests spread. For example, bark beetles found a new home. They have moved to Canada. Before, it was too cold. Now the beetles are killing forests there. Dead trees mean more fires.

A picture of a very skinny polar bear came out this week. It has now been seen more than 3 million times.

The bear looks weak. It has trouble moving on ice. It is hunting for food.

The photo has people talking about global warming.

A Warmer Earth Melts North Pole Ice

The Earth is heating up. Most scientists think that it is because of the fuel that people use. People burn these fuels to make energy. Things like cars and electric lights run on this energy.

Scientists say a hotter Earth is melting ice on the North Pole.

Polar bears depend on the ice. They live there. Polar bears also hunt on the ice. They eat seals and whales.

Paul Nicklen is a photographer. He took the video of the bear. He takes pictures for National Geographic magazine.

He leads a nonprofit group. It tells stories and shows pictures to make people think about the environment.

"What Starvation Looks Like"

The polar bear shown has patchy fur. It looks very sick. It searches for food in an old garbage can.

The polar bear photo was shared on the social media site Instagram. Soon, many TV stations and newspapers talked about it.

Nicklen said he cried as he watched the bear. He hopes the image makes people think more about the environment. "This is what starvation looks like ... It's a slow, painful death."

The photo was shot on Somerset Island, in northern Canada. Nicklen grew up nearby. He said he had never seen a polar bear like this one.

There are about 25,000 polar bears on Earth. Experts expect this number to go down. One out of three polar bears could die in the next few years. As the ice melts, more polar bears will likely starve.

Scientists warn that climate change could make polar bears gone forever. They say this might happen before the year 2050.

A recent study came out. It said that a warmer Earth means that polar bears might come into contact with humans more. Bears may even attack people.

No Food And Nowhere To Live

Some were not convinced the bear's health was linked to climate change. One was a commenter on the National Geographic's Facebook page. What if the bear was just sick because of something else?

Dr. Donald Moore is a polar bear expert. He said he could not tell much about the bear's age or health from the video.

But he believes that the bear was starving because it did not have a place to hunt or live. He said climate change is to blame.

Bears need a huge amount of food, he said. They normally eat about one seal each week.

Scientists want to send humans to Mars. This has never been done before. Mars is the closest planet to Earth.

NASA is building a rocket to go to Mars. NASA is the government's space program. The rocket is called the Space Launch System. A company called Boeing is helping. Boeing builds airplanes and spaceships.

Tiera Fletcher works at Boeing. She is an engineer. She is working on the Space Launch System. It is the largest rocket ever built.

Question: What was your life like growing up?

Fletcher: I grew up in a small town called Mableton. It is right outside of Atlanta, Georgia. The town is very small. It doesn't even have a mayor.

I was very interested in math as a kid. My mom would take me on trips to the store. She would have me calculate the price of our groceries. Later, my interests grew. I wanted to be a mathematician. I also wanted to be an inventor and scientist.

Q: What is aerospace engineering, and how did you become interested in it?

Fletcher: Engineers solve problems. They do so by building products, such as machines. They might also build systems. A system is a set of things that work together. Aerospace engineers work with airplanes and spaceships.

Image 2. Tiera Fletcher in a flight simulator. Fletcher became interested in aerospace engineering when she was 11 years old. Photo: Tiera and Myron Fletcher
I took part in a school program at age 11. It was about aerospace engineering. I decided that I wanted to become an aerospace engineer.

In high school, I studied reverse thrust. Thrust is a pushing force. It moves airplanes forward. Engines create thrust. They burn fuel to push a lot of air backward. This causes the plane to move forward.

Reverse thrust is a system. It is used in planes. It changes the direction that the air is pushed from the engine. It helps pilots slow down before they land.

Q: What did you study in college?

Fletcher: I knew I wanted to study aerospace engineering. I decided to go to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It is a university in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

I focused on structural design and analysis. I designed parts of systems. Then, I analyzed those parts. I wanted to make them work better.

Q: How did you come to work at Boeing, and what do you do there now?

Fletcher: I worked as an intern at Boeing. Later, the company offered me a job.

Today, I work on the Space Launch System. I design some of its parts. The rocket is being built and tested now. It will be the largest rocket ever created. Its goal is to send astronauts to Mars.

Q: What kind of challenges have you faced in the workforce and how did you overcome them?

Fletcher: I'm 25, African American and female. Most of the people I work with are older males. This has been a challenge. People may have unfair or negative beliefs about me.

I have been able to rise above this challenge. I work hard to prove that I can do my job well. It takes confidence and courage.

Q: What advice do you have for students who might be interested in a career like yours?

Fletcher: Do your research! Also, keep an open mind. There are so many options out there in science, technology, engineering and math. Try them all out. Keep trying new subjects until you find your passion.

Do not limit yourself! You are capable of more, you can do more, and you can be more. Always shoot to be more.

Editor's Note: The following article is from September 8, 2020. This was two months before the 2020 presidential election. The election was between Joseph Biden and Donald Trump.

More young Muslim Americans are excited about voting. Muslims are people who follow the religion of Islam. These young people are getting involved in elections.

Machhadie Assi is an immigrant from Lebanon. It is a small Middle Eastern country. In 2019, Assi met with voters in her community. She helped three elderly women register to vote.

Assi said 2016 was an important year. That year, former President Donald Trump made an order. The order targeted Muslim immigrants.

The order first called out seven countries. The countries were Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. All of these countries had large Muslim populations. These countries were in the Middle East and North Africa region. The Islamic religion began around this region. But only about 1 out of 5 Muslims in the world live there.

The first two versions of the order were struck down by federal courts. A third version was approved by the Supreme Court. They upheld the order in June 2018.

President Joe Biden reversed the order on January 20, 2021. Since then, Muslims have been more politically active. They are voting more. Many are running for office.

This increasing activity is seen in Dearborn. It is a city in Michigan. It has one of the largest Arab American and Muslim communities in the country.

Dearborn Community Was Thriving
Arab immigrants arrived in Michigan in the late 1800s. Many found work in factories. Today, Dearborn has about 95,000 residents. About 43,500 of them claim Arab ancestry.

Not all Arab Americans are Muslim. However, most people in Dearborn are Muslim. Dearborn has one of the largest mosques in North America. It is the Islamic Center of America. A mosque is a place of worship for Muslims. This mosque serves the local Shiite community. Shiite and Sunnis make up the two main branches of Islam. Around the world, about 10 percent of the Muslim population is Shiite.

The Nation of Islam began in Michigan in 1930. This is a Black political and religious movement. But the majority of the Black Muslim population does not belong to the Nation of Islam. Muslims of African ancestry have been in North America for hundreds of years.

Dearborn's community has different cultural influences. Arabic and English are common languages. Arabic is the most common language in the Middle East. However, not everyone in the Middle East speaks Arabic.

Voters Look At All Issues
National issues are important to Arab American voters. One example is foreign policy. This is how the United States interacts with other countries. Local issues are also important. For example, air pollution is one concern. Poor air is connected to rising asthma rates in the Yemeni community. Asthma is a condition that makes it hard to breathe.

Muslim American organizations are doing important work. These groups are connecting with their Arab American voters. They are educating voters on the issues. They can help people register to vote.

Time To Be Heard By Voting
On September 11, 2001, the United States was attacked. This is known as 9/11. The attackers were from the Middle East. After 9/11, untrue rumors spread about Muslim Americans, people of Middle Eastern ancestry and Sikhs. These groups became targets of discrimination.

In 2016, Abdullah Hammoud won a state election in Michigan. He became a representative in the state's House of Representatives. Hammoud was the first Arab American Muslim to represent Dearborn's 15th District.

In 2018, more Arab American and Muslim voters turned out. Rashida Tlaib was elected to Congress. She is the daughter of Palestinian immigrants. Tlaib is also from Detroit.

Hammoud believes Muslim Americans helped him to win. It is important for them to see more Muslims take part in politics. They are helping to run the country. Their voices are being heard.

Some kids can now get the COVID-19 vaccine. It is approved for those 12 or older.

A vaccine is often a shot. It helps keep the body safe from viruses. The COVID-19 illness happens because of a virus. Vaccines give you immunity. This means your body can fight off an illness. This is just one way to get immunity. You can also get it from having the illness.

Getting Approval
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the vaccine. It is part of the U.S. federal government. The FDA approves new drugs. It makes sure that food and drugs are safe.

Companies that make medicines run tests. They see how well a drug or vaccine works. They then give this information to the FDA. (You can learn more here.)

The vaccine was first tested in adults. The next vaccine tests were in teenagers. Now, children under 12 are getting tested.

The FDA approved a vaccine for teens on May 10th. The vaccine was made by Pfizer. On May 12th, another group looked at the FDA's approval. It was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It works to prevent and fight disease. The CDC also voted to allow teens to get the vaccine.

Some states started giving the vaccine after the FDA said it was okay. Other states were waiting for the CDC. Soon, anyone 12 or older can get the vaccine in more states.

Why Get Vaccinated?
COVID-19 has many symptoms. Some are: a fever, runny nose, cough and loss of taste or smell. Some children have few symptoms. Others have more. Getting a vaccine helps keep you from getting sick. It helps to keep the people around you safe.

Scientists and doctors want many people to get the vaccine. They want them to have immunity. The more people who have immunity, the less the virus spreads. This is known as herd immunity.

Scheduling A COVID-19 Shot
You may need an appointment. Your parent or caregiver can help you make one. Each state has its own way of giving out vaccines. Check the website for your state. The vaccine is free.

The Pfizer vaccine is two shots. You will need two visits. They will be about a month apart. You will get one shot at each visit. After you get your shot, you might feel side effects. Your arm might hurt a little. You might have a fever. These feelings should go away. If they do not, have your parents or caregiver call your doctor.

Vaccinated In Time For School This Fall?
Many students have been learning from home. This has been hard. A lot needs to happen to go back to school. Keeping more people safe from COVID-19 is the first step. Vaccines can help.
