Q Write the 4 vocabulary terms here.
Scientists investigate. They plan and do a test to answer a question or solve a problem. They use inquiry skills and science tools to help them.
There are many ways to investigate. But many scientists follow a sequence, or order of events. Here's one possible sequence. First, scientists may observe and ask a question.
► What objects will these children use for their test?
Kl	A	i	Circle	them.
Now, scientists can make
a hypothesis, A hypothesis is a statement that can be tested.
Then scientists plan a fair test.
The scientists list the materials they will need and the steps they will take to do their test.

Next, the scientists are ready to do their test. They follow their plan and record what they observe.
Active Reading
Clue words can help you find the order of things. Next is a clue word. Circle this clue word in the paragraph above.
After the test, scientists draw conclusions. They use the information they have gathered to decide if their results support the hypothesis. Finally, they write or draw to communicate what
they learned.
How does the temperature of water affect how fast the food coloring spreads? Draw
Let:^ Checlc Again
Scientists do the same test a few times.
They need to make sure that they get similar results every time. In this investigation, the food coloring should spread faster in warm water every time.
Look at the warm cup for both Monday and Friday. Draw a conclusion. Color in the warm cup for Wednesday to show what it should look like.

Animals are living things. Humans are living things, too. Just like plants, animals and humans have basic needs. They must meet their basic
needs in order to survive, or stay alive.
What basic need are these animals getting? How does this make animals like plants?

Do you wonder why people put some potted plants by windows? Plants need sunlight to grow. They also need air and water. Plants use air, water, and sunlight to make their own food.
Active Riding
Underline the sentence that tells what plants need to make food.
Nutrients and Space
Plants need nutrients from the soil. Nutrients are substances that help plants grow. Growing plants need more nutrients and water. Their roots grow and spread to get more of these things. Plants need enough space for their roots, stems, and leaves to arow.

Drip Irrigation
Irrigation is a way to get water to land so plants can grow. A lawn sprinkler is one kind of irrigation.
Drip irrigation is another kind of irrigation. Hoses carry water to plants. Water drips from emitters on the hoses. This brings water right to the soil around the plants.
Less water is wasted. Less
water evaporates.

As a young girl, Maria Elena Zavala thought a lot
about plants. Her grandmother lived next door. She grew
plants to use as medicine. Young Maria learned about
those plants from her grandmother.
Today Maria Elena Zavala is a botanist and a teacher.
A botanist is a scientist who studies plants. Dr. Zavala
studies how plants respond to their environment.
She and her students are finding out how roots grow.

Earth is always changing. Some changes are fast. They happen in minutes, hours, or days.
An earthquake is a fast change.
An earthquake is a shaking of Earth's surface. Floods and eruptions from volcanoes are fast changes, too. A volcano is a place where hot melted rock comes out of the ground.
When things are compared, you find out ways they are alike. Draw triangles around two things that are being compared.
fmm Hi mem
Some changes to Earth are slow.
Slow changes happen over many months or years. Weathering is a slow change. Weathering happens when wind and water break down rock into smaller pieces.
Erosion is also a slow change. Erosion happens when wind and water move rocks and soil. It changes the shape of land.

What question would you
ask a geologist?

What is a geologist?
A geologist is a scientist who
studies Earth. We study the
materials on Earth, such as
rocks, soil, and water.
M
How do geologists work?
Some geologists dig up
rocks. They work outside
with hiking shoes and picks.
Others stay in a lab. They
use machines to collect and
study data about Earth.
How does your work
help people?
Geologists find water, oil.
and gas underground. These
are resources people need.
We also study earthquakes
and volcanoes to help
people stay safe.

What kinds of storms do storm chasers look for? Most storm chasers look for tornadoes. A few storm chasers look for hurricanes.
How do you work?
Storm chasers watch the weather carefully. We learn about bad storms. We try to predict where to find them. Then we drive to see a storm.
How does storm chasing help other people?
Most storm chasers work with weather centers. If we spot a storm, we can alert the police and people on farms.

Growing up, Annie Jump Cannon liked to look at stars. She eventually became an astronomer An astronomer is a scientist who studies stars, planets, and other objects in space.
Cannon studied pictures of stars. The pictures helped her sort stars into groups. Her picture groups were a new way to classify stars. Scientists still classify stars this way today.

The girl and the objects around her are matter. Matter is anything that takes up space and has mass. Mass is the amount of matter in an object.
Matter has properties. A property is one part of what something is like. Some properties are color, shape, size, and texture.
Active Riding»
Find the sentence that tells the meaning of mass. Draw a line under the sentence.
Properties of Matter
► Look at the objects in each row. Draw something that has the same property.
color

Solid，liquid, and gas are three states of matter. The boy's sunglasses are a solid. The water in his bottle is a liquid. The beach ball is filled with aases.
Active Riding
The main idea is the most important idea about something. Draw two lines under the main idea.
What two states of matter make up the beach ball?
352
Solid as a Rock
Look at the chair, the towel, and the hat.
How are these objects the same? The answer is that all three are solids.
A solid is the only state of matter that has its own shape. You can measure the mass of a solid. What other solids do you see in this picture?
Shape Up!
Is juice a solid? No. It does not have its own shape. If you pour juice from a pitcher into a glass, the shape of the juice changes.
Juice is a liquid. A liquid is a state of matter that takes the shape of its container. You can measure the volume of a liquid. Volume is the amount of space that matter takes up.
► Compare the pitcher to the glass on its right. Which container has the larger volume?
Life’s a Gas
This girl is blowing air into the beach ball. Air is made up of gases. A gas is a state of matter that fills all the space in its container. The air will keep spreading out until it fills the entire beach ball.
Find the sentence that tells the meaning of gas. Draw a line under the sentence.
You can’t see air, but you can see and feel what it does.

Deep Freeze
Taking away or adding heat can change water Think about making ice. Put water in the freezer.
The water freezes into solid ice. Take the ice out of the freezer. It melts into a liquid.
Freezing changes some properties of water.
Ice has its own shape. Liquid water does not.
Freezing makes water expand. So ice takes up more space than water.

You can feel heat from many things. Heat from the sun warms Earth. Moving things that rub together give off heat. Rubbing your hands together warms them up. Burning fuel gives off heat. Some fuels cook food and heat homes.
Adding heat warms things. Taking away heat cools thinas.

The sun, electric lights, and fire all give off light. Light is energy that lets you see. The amount of light can change how you see things.
The amount of light can change how you see the color of an object. Adding more light can make an object look brighter. Taking away light can make an object look dimmer.
How Much Light?
Different materials let different amounts of light pass through.

A magnet is an object that can pull things made of iron and steel. A magnet can push or pull other magnets.
A magnet has two poles. A pole is a place on a magnet where the pull is the greatest.
One pole is the north-seeking, or N, pole.
The other pole is the south-seeking, or S, pole.
^Active Riding f	入
Find the sentence that tells the meaning of pole. Draw a line under the sentence.

Opposite poles, or poles that are different, attract each other. Attract means to pull toward something.

but not others. Look at these boxes. Which thinas
are attracted to a magnet? Which things are not?

Look at the way the magnet pulls the paper clips right through the hand! A
magnet does not have to touch an object to move it.
This is possible because of its magnetic field.
This is the area around a magnet where the magnetic force is felt.
