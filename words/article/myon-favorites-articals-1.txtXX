FOREWORD
  On Thursday, November 21, 1963, President John F. Kennedy and his wife, Jackie, said good-bye to their two children and left Washington, D.C. The Kennedys were flying to San Antonio at the start of a three-day tour through Texas. Before leaving, the president promised his son, John (known to the public as "John John’), that he would be back to celebrate Johns third birthday on Monday.
  The Texas trip was an important one for Kennedy. He
hoped to improve relationships between conservative and liberal Democrats in the state while gaining support for the upcoming 1964 election. Kennedy planned to run for a second term, and Texas held a large number of electoral votes he needed to win. Even though his vice president, Lyndon Johnson, was from Texas, there were strong antLKennedy feelings in the state, especially in the conservative city of Dallas. Kennedy hoped that he and Jackie could charm Texans on this trip and win some of them over.
    Air Force One landed in San Antonio at 1:30 p.m.
Vice President Johnson had also just arrived, but he waited with Texas Governor John Connally to greet the president. Afterward the Kennedys attended the dedication of the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine at Brooks Air Force Base. Then they flew to Houston and the president spoke to the League of United Latin American Citizens at the Rice Hotel. Next the presidential party attended a dinner at the Sam Houston Coliseum. That night the Kennedys flew to Fort Worth, where a third motorcade took them to the Texas Hotel for a welLearned night s rest. The first day of the Texas tour had gone extremely well. So far the crowds had been enthusiastic and there was every reason to hope that people in Dallas would be just as friendly and welcoming when they met them the next day.

"WHAT’S IN THE PACKAGE LEEJ -
         Lee Howey OswoM 2515 West Fifth Street, Irving, Texas, November 22, 1963, 7:00 a.m.
         (Central Standard Time)
Marina and Lee Harvey Oswald
              Lee Harvey Oswald dressed quietly, preparing for the day. Turning around, he saw that his wife, Marina, was awake and looking at him. He continued dressing in silence, knowing they had little to say to one another. Although he still spent time in Marinas home, their marriage, for all practical purposes, was over.
              The house belonged to Ruth Paine, a good friend of Marinas. Oswald stayed at the house some nights to visit with his two daughters, but yesterday he had found himself an unwelcome guest. He usually came on a Friday night, but this time showed up on a Thursday instead. Marina was not pleased, and all his

pleading with her to get back together only seemed to harden her resolve to keep him away.
   At 24 years of age, Oswald had felt like a misfit for as long as he could remember. Now he seemed to be facing nothing but dead ends in his life. A former Marine, he defected to the Soviet Union in 1959, hoping to find a better life there under Communism. But the government gave him a boring factory job in Minsk, and he quickly became disillusioned with the Communist system.
   When Oswald met Marina at a dance in 1961, it seemed like the best thing to happen to him during his time in Russia. They were married six weeks later. He returned to the United States with Marina in 1962. By then they had a daughter, June, but their marriage was falling apart. Oswald was disappointed by how quickly Marina fell in love with America and its materialism. He knew that she could not forgive his inability to support her and June financially. Marina soon began living with Paine, a Quaker who wanted Marina to teach her Russian.
   Oswald had reached a crossroads in his life. He was stuck in a poor-paying job packing textbooks
at the Texas School Book Depository—a job Paine helped him get. He had little hope of earning enough money to support his family, which now included a second daughter, one-month-old Audrey. He was reaching the end of his rope.
   Oswald finished dressing as Marina fed the baby. He went out into the garage to retrieve the rifle he had left there, wrapped in a blanket. He put the weapon into a long, brown paper package he had fashioned at work. Then, stepping back into the house, he removed his wedding ring, placed it in a china cup, and left $187 on the bureau. With the package under his arm, Oswald left the house and walked the half block to the home of his coworker, Buell Frazier.
   As they climbed into Frazier s beat-up Chevy, Frazier glanced over his shoulder. ""What’s in the package, Lee?” he asked.
   ""Curtain rods,” replied Oswald, hoping the rifle s disguise would fool Frazier.
   Frazier nodded. “How come you aren’t bringing a lunch to work?” he asked.
   "Tm going to buy it,” Oswald said.
   His real plan for the lunch hour did not involve eating, but that was no one else s business. As the two men headed for downtown Dallas, the mornings light rain began to fall more steadily from the cold, gray sky.
     Twenty-six-year-old Bob Schieffer pulled his two-seat Triumph sports car into his mother s driveway and wearily went inside the house. He was used to keeping late hours as the night police reporter at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, but this had been an especially long night. He had left the office in the early morning and arrived at the Press Club around 2:00 a.m. The club was open to accommodate the White House press corps. They were part of the presidential entourage that had just come to town. Kennedy’s visit to Fort Worth was a big story, but Schieffer was just a police

        reporter and wouldn’t be assigned to the presidential beat. If he couldn’t cover the president, he decided, at least he could mix with the big-name reporters who were on the story.
           Sometime in the wee hours, the reporters decided to leave the Press Club for an after-hours club called the Cellar. Schieffer and one of his editors became their guides. They were soon joined at the Cellar by several off-duty Secret Service agents looking for some relaxation.
           By the time the group left the club, the sun was coming up. Schieffer’s mother and younger brother, Tom, were planning to go to the Texas Hotel that morning to catch a glimpse of Kennedy as he left for the airport and his flight to Dallas. But Schieffer had no intention of joining them. He’d enjoy a good sleep, and by the time he awoke the president would be long gone.

     Texas Hotel, Fort Worth, 8:00 a.m.
            The day was not getting off to a good start for the vice president. Yesterday he had been publicly humiliated by a fellow Texan, liberal Senator Ralph Yarborough. On two separate occasions Johnson had invited the senator to ride with him in his car in the motorcade, and twice Yarborough had ignored the invitation and ridden with someone else. He was no friend of the conservative Johnson. Now Johnson sat staring at the front page of the Dallas Morning News where the headline used big, bold letters to declare: “YARBOROUGH SNUBS LBJ.” Now everyone could read about this embarrassing incident in the paper.
            The vice president thought about the feud that divided liberal Texas Democrats, like Yarborough, and more conservative

Democrats, such as Johnson himself This division was one reason Kennedy had made the trip to Texas* But he and Johnson were also gathering votes, preparing for the fast-approaching 1964 election* The election was yet another source of concern weighing on his mind*
   Johnson was well aware of the rumors that Kennedy would dump him from the ticket in 1964* While he feared this, at the same time he didn't exactly relish the thought of being vice president for another term* Johnson had given up a powerful position as Senate Majority Leader to take the office* As vice president he had become the powerless butt of many White House jokes*
   Johnson had taken the job in part because it could eventually lead to the presidency after Kennedy's potential second term was over* But now he found himself competing for power with the president's brother, Robert* Robert, or “Bobby," as he was called, was the nation's attorney general and harbored presidential ambitions of his own*

join Kennedy and Governor Connally for a rally in the damp parking lot across the street, where a large crowd of union members was gathering. It would be Johnsons role, as usual, to introduce the president. Another thankless task for the number-two man.

As Senate Majority Leader from 1955 to 1961, Lyndon Johnson held a great deal of power in Washington, D.C.
AbvakaMt Z,awiuLev
Dai-Tex building, Dallas, 9:00 a.m.
    As Abraham Zapruder entered the office, his secretary, Lillian Rodgers, greeted him. “Where's your camera?” she asked.
    “It’s raining,” Zapruder replied. “It’ll spoil the filming.”
    Zapruder, owner of a women’s garment factory, was an avid home moviemaker. A transplanted New Yorker, he was also an enthusiastic Democrat and Kennedy admirer. He had been planning for days to film the presidential motorcade, scheduled to come through nearby Dealey Plaza around noon.
    Rodgers pointed out the window. The rain clouds had given way to sunshine, and she urged him to go back for his camera. “How many times will you have a crack at color movies of the president?” she asked.
16
       Zapruder had to admit that it was an opportunity he wouldn’t have again. He turned around and went home for the camera.
       Nellie Connally, wife of Governor John Connally, couldn’t be more pleased with how things were going. This was the first time a Texas governor had played host to a sitting president, and her husband had planned every moment carefully. The crowds in San Antonio and Fort Worth had been warm and enthusiastic toward the young president. But the next destination, Dallas, was likely to be a different story.
       Dallas was a conservative stronghold, and its citizens had vocally disapproved of the liberal Kennedy. Connally feared that the results of the visit could be embarrassing. Only a month earlier, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson, a Kennedy supporter, had been
 attacked during a visit to Dallas* She prayed that no such incident would mar the president s visit*
    Connally finished dressing and headed downstairs to the Chamber of Commerce breakfast about to begin in the Grand Ballroom* She entered the ballroom to find it packed by wall-to-wall tables that seated nearly 3,000 people who had come to hear Kennedy speak* But someone was missing from the head table* Jackie Kennedy, the presidents wife, was not there* Was the First Lady ill? Connally hoped not* She didn't want anything to spoil this memorable visit*

  Texas Hotel, Fort Worth, 9:10 a.ra.
    In the two years he had served and guarded Jackie Kennedy, Secret Service agent Clint Hill had come to respect and admire her* Now, at his security post, he received a troubling phone call* It was agent Bill Duncan, calling from downstairs* “Clint," he said, “the president wants you to bring Mrs* Kennedy down to the breakfast—now!"
18
   Hill entered the presidential suite. Jackie was dressed in her pink outfit, but showed no sign of being ready to go anywhere. When he delivered the president s request, the First Lady reluctantly agreed to accompany him downstairs.
   He could understand why she might want to bow out of the event. This was the first time since her husband had become president that she had accompanied him on a domestic campaign tour. Hill knew it had to be exhausting. On top of that, he knew she was still recovering from the loss of the couple s second son, Patrick, who had died on August 9, 39 hours after being born.
   As Hill and the First Lady entered the ballroom, the entire room burst into applause. He heard someone say, “Oh, isn’t she lovely?” The president grinned as Jackie took her place at the head table.
   After the breakfast, Hill and Roy Kellerman, the president’s personal Secret Service agent, escorted the first couple back to their suite. Once the Kennedys were gone, the two agents went over the details of the upcoming motorcade trip. The plan involved traveling from the Dallas airport, Love Field, to the Trade Mart where
the president would speak at a luncheon. The presidential limousine had been flown to Dallas and would be waiting for them at Love Field.
   The limo had a Plexiglas bubble top that could be attached in case of bad weather. This job would fall to the limo s driver, agent Sam Kinney. Kellerman reminded Hill that Kennedy didn’t like using the bubble top because he felt that it came between him and the public. He believed people wanted to feel close to their president at these moments. But, Hill reasoned, if the weather was rainy, as it was in Fort Worth, Kennedy would have less reason to object to the bubble top. Kellerman called the advance agent in Dallas for a weather report. He said the skies were clearing and the sun was shining.
   Kellerman turned to Hill. “Tell Sam, top off,” he said.

    Lee Harvey Oswald steadily packed schoolbooks into cartons. As he worked, his gaze kept traveling to the southeast corner of the sixth floor, where the cartons were stacked in big piles. The floor had been cleared to allow the maintenance crew to replace the old floorboards, long in need of renovation. The box piles would serve as a perfect camouflage as he made his preparations.
    The boxes hid the southeast window, which Oswald expected would provide an excellent view of the motorcade as it passed down Elm Street through Dealey Plaza. He carefully unwrapped the brown paper package he’d brought along and removed from inside a bolt-action 6.5 mm Italian rifle with a telescopic lens. He had bought the weapon through the mail from a Chicago sporting goods company for $21.45. Oswald had learned how to shoot in the Marines and had proved a good marksman. In just two hours he would put his marksmanship to the ultimate test.

 Fort Worth, 10:41 a.m.
   Nellie Connally was not riding with her husband to Carswell. Instead, she found herself in the car with the Johnsons and Senator Yarborough. Connally wondered how Yarborough had finally been persuaded to accept the vice president s invitation to ride. She imagined President Kennedy had something to do with it.
   Of course, Connally had heard about Yarborough snubbing the vice president yesterday, but she didn’t relish the thought of getting involved and trying to become a peacemaker. Instead of sitting between the two men, she rode up front next to one of the Secret Service agents. It was a quiet ride. The vice president and senator sat in stony silence in the backseat. They finally arrived at Carswell to find another large crowd. Connally hoped the crowd would be as large and as friendly when they landed at Love Field.

   Lyndon Johnson
   Love Field, Dallas, 11:35 a.m.
         The vice presidents plane touched down several minutes ahead of Air Force One. Johnson knew the routine all too well. He and his wife, Lady Bird, would disembark and then wait to greet the Kennedys as they descended from their plane. It was, Johnson felt, rather silly, considering they had all been traveling together for the past two days.
         Johnson had insisted that they travel by motorcade from the airport through the city instead of driving directly to the Trade Mart. He wanted to show the world that, even in the supposedly anti-Kennedy stronghold of Dallas, the president was loved. But Johnson expected his real moment to come that night when they left the gala fund-raiser dinner in Austin and arrived at his ranch outside town. He and Lady Bird would host the Kennedys for the night and all day Saturday. It would show the world

   Johnson took Lady Birds hand and headed for the crowd* But he soon realized that the people were only interested in the first couple* The Johnsons quickly retreated to their car* After a few minutes, the Kennedys returned and the motorcade began to move* The Connallys had the honor of riding in the presidential limo, while Johnson again had to endure the company of Senator Yarborough* Lady Bird sat between the two men and tried to make conversation, despite the silence between Johnson and Yarborough*

Rufus Youngblood, Johnsons Secret Service agent, rode up front with the driver. After a few minutes, the vice presidents car joined the motorcade, heading slowly toward downtown Dallas.

    Oswald waited patiently for the other workers to leave the building for lunch. Many were going to watch the president s motorcade pass by. Oswald, convinced he was alone on the sixth floor, went to get his rifle. Suddenly he heard the rickety elevator stop and footsteps approaching.
    It was fellow worker Charles Givens. “Forgot my cigarettes,” Givens said, going for the pocket of his jacket. Then he turned back to Oswald. “Boy, aren’t you coming downstairs?” he asked. “It’s near lunchtime.”
    “No, sir,” Oswald replied politely.
    He asked Givens if he would close the gate of the west elevator so he could summon it up later. Givens

agreed. Alone again, Oswald gazed out the open window. A large crowd was gathering along Dealey Plaza, a grassy, open area. Oswald looked at his watch. The presidential motorcade was due to pass in about half an hour.

   As the motorcade pulled out of the airport, Agent Hill walked alongside the presidential limo next to where the First Lady sat. Agent Bill Greer, a jovial Irishman and a Kennedy favorite, was at the wheel. Agent Kellerman sat beside him. Hill noted that one car ahead of the president’s was driven by Dallas Police chief Jesse Curry.
   The presidential limo was a long blue Lincoln, specially rebuilt and enlarged. It had two jump seats in the middle and elevated seats in the rear so that Americans could get a better view of their president. The car was equipped with running boards and steps in the back for Secret Service agents to stand on.

   As the motorcade picked up speed, Hill fell behind. He jumped onto the running board of the Secret Service car, known as Halfback, which was directly behind the presidents limo. Three other agents stood on the running boards with Hill, while presidential aides Ken O’Donnell and Dave Powers rode in jump seats. Hill turned to see the vice president’s car directly behind. Bringing up the rear were the press cars.
   As they drew closer to downtown, Hill noticed that the crowds were growing larger. He scanned the crowds with a sharp eye, looking for any sign of troublemakers or anything unusual. He’d be glad when the motorcade ended and they reached the Trade Mart.

    When the four reporters entered the car, Smitty, as he was known to his colleagues, took the front seat, where the radio telephone was located* Crammed into the backseat were Jack Bell of the Associated Press (AP), Bob Clark of ABC News, and Robert Barber of the Dallas Morning News.

       Short, stocky Abe Zapruder knew he’d have a hard time filming the president over the heads of the people in the crowd. Because of this, he arrived early at the plaza to set up his camera. He was accompanied by his receptionist, Marilyn Sitzman, who came to help him.
       Zapruder set up on a low concrete abutment that lay near the triple underpass into which the motorcade would move as it left Dealey Plaza. As he fidgeted with his zoom lens, he turned to Sitzman and tried to kid around with her. But the joking did not entirely soothe his nervousness. He assumed he would only have a few precious seconds to catch the passing motorcade on film and he didn’t want anything to go wrong.

      The knots of people lining the streets grew larger as the motorcade drew toward downtown. At one point they passed a young man holding up a sign that read: “PLEASE MR. PRESIDENT STOP AND SHAKE OUR HANDS!” To Hills alarm, the president had Agent Greer stop the car. Kennedy stood up as the man with the sign and the people around him rushed forward to greet him.
      As the motorcade resumed, Hill moved up and jumped on the rear of the president s limousine. The president turned and looked at him without speaking. Hill knew Kennedy didn’t like him doing that. He wanted to avoid agents coming between him and the public. But Hill stayed where he was. The president had a job to do, but so did Hill.

          Advertising editor John Newnam listened patiently as Jack Ruby chattered away on a variety of topics. Although not a big spender, Ruby, a local nightclub owner, was a steady advertiser with the paper, and Newnam felt obliged to hear him out. Ruby was in the process of complaining about the full-page, anti-Kennedy ad that had appeared in that days edition. It angered Ruby for two reasons. One, he was an admirer of the president, and two, the ad was signed by one “Bernard Weissman.” Ruby explained that “Weissman” sounded Jewish. He felt the mans ad would reflect badly on all Jews, including Ruby himself.
          Finally, to Newnams relief, Ruby got back to business. He wrote out a check in the amount of $36.87 for ads for his nightspots,
33
the Carousel Club and the Vegas Club*
   Taking the check, Newnam was dismayed to realize that Ruby still wasn't finished talking* Now he began explaining how he wouldn't stand for troublemakers in his clubs and that he knew how to defend himself* He boasted about a *38 revolver that he always carried with him* Finally, he seemed to be finished* As he walked away Newnam wondered why, as such a great admirer of the president, Ruby wasn't out watching Kennedy's motorcade drive past just a few blocks away*

the triple underpass that would take them onto Stemmons Freeway and to the Trade Mart. But before that, Connally wanted the president to know how pleased she was with how well the visit was going. “Mr. President,” she said, turning to him, “you cant say that Dallas doesn’t love you!” The smile on Kennedy’s youthful face widened as the limo’s driver slowed down and made a careful turn.
The Kennedys and the Connallys greeted crowds of supporters as the motorcade made its way through Dallas.

          Abe Zapruder stared at the president through the zoom lens of his Bell and Howell. Kennedy looked almost close enough to touch. Zapruder followed the cars movement, swinging the camera to the right. Then suddenly a freeway sign obscured the view. As the car reappeared, Zapruder saw a strange look come into the president s eyes and his hands go for his throat. For a moment he thought that Kennedy, who had a keen sense of humor, was mocking his own death. It was as if he was saying, “Oh, they got me.” An instant later it was all too clear that this was no act. As Zapruder looked on in horror, he saw part of Kennedys head explode. “They killed him! They killed him!” he screamed over and over as the camera continued to roll.

     Presidential motorcade, Dallas, 12:30 p.m.
        Having moved back to Halfback, Agent Hill stood on the running board, scanning the crowd. Suddenly he heard a loud noise behind him. He looked ahead and saw Kennedy put his hands to his throat and fall leftward. Hill leaped off Halfback and sprinted for the presidents car. There was a second shot. Hill was almost on the car when a third shot rang out. It sounded to him like the sound of a melon shattering onto concrete.
        At that moment blood sprayed his face, hair, and clothes. Still running, he grabbed a handhold on the rear of the limo. The car lurched forward, Hills feet still on the pavement. He managed to pull himself up onto the rear of the limo as it sped forward. Looking up he saw Jackie Kennedy, on hands and knees, climbing back onto the trunk.

    Good God, he thought, Shes going to go flying off the back of the carl He grabbed her and pushed her back into the seat. As he did, the president s body fell to the left onto her lap. “Get us to a hospital!” he cried to Agent Greer, who was driving.
 Presidential motorcade, Dallas, 12:30 p.m.
   Nellie Connally turned to see the look of stunned surprise in Kennedys eyes as he seized his throat.
   “No, no, no!” she heard her husband cry, the same surprised look in his eyes. “My God,” he yelled, “they are going to kill us all!” Then he slumped down in the seat. Connally pulled him into her lap, just as a third shot came.
   From behind she heard Jackie shriek, “They’ve killed my husband!”
   Connally was terrified that her husband was dead too. But now he stirred in her arms. Her husband was alive. As the limo picked up speed, she pulled his right arm over his chest. “Be still,” she whispered. “It is going to be all right.”

          Lee Harvey Oswald carefully hid his rifle between two rows of boxes. Unable to use the elevator, he rushed down the stairwell to the second floor. As he entered the workers’ lunchroom he ran into his supervisor, Roy Truly, and a motorcycle officer who appeared to be asking questions about the shooting. The officer looked sharply at Oswald. “Come here,” he said, drawing his revolver. “Do you know this man?” he asked Truly. “Does he work here?” Truly said he did. The officer nodded, turned away, and Oswald made his escape from the building.
          As he ran out the front entrance, Oswald was stopped by a man who he took for a Secret Service agent. “Where’s the phone?” the man asked. Oswald directed him into the building and headed down the street.
   Presidential motorcade, Dallas, 12:33 p.m.
      As a target shooter, Merriman Smith knew guns. When he said that was gunfire, the other reporters in the car believed him. He could see a flurry of activity in the Secret Service car ahead. The vehicle had only stopped for a few seconds, but the pause felt like a lifetime.
      Smith composed his thoughts for a minute and then reached for the radio phone. He called the UPI Bureau in Dallas. “Three shots were fired at the motorcade ... ” Smith dictated. In moments, the teletype operator was dashing out a five-bell bulletin. Smith realized the bulletin was likely the first word to the world of the tragedy:
      DALLAS, NOV. 22 (UPI)—THREE SHOTS WERE FIRED AT PRESIDENT KENNEDY’S MOTORCADE IN DOWNTOWN DALLAS.

   From the backseat of the car, Jack Bell called out, “Smitty, you have had your turn, give it to me now.” As the press car sped after the two cars ahead of it, Smith and Bell grappled for the phone. By the time Bell got it, the line had gone dead. The car came to a screeching halt at the Parkland Memorial Hospital emergency room entrance and everyone tumbled out.
   As the presidential limo arrived at the emergency room entrance, Hill and other Secret Service agents were ready to rush the stricken president inside. But Jackie Kennedy held her husband tightly in the blood-drenched backseat.
   “Mrs. Kennedy, please let us help the president,” pleaded Hill. But she only released her hold when Hill covered the presidents head and upper torso with his suit coat. Then, with Kellerman and two others, Hill lifted the limp body onto a waiting hospital gurney. Jackie followed them into Trauma

     Downtown Dallas, 12:40 p.m.
            Oswald was on the move. He caught a bus seven blocks from the depository, but he got off shortly after boarding. A few minutes later he got into a cab at the Greyhound bus station. He had the cabbie drop him off a short walk from his rooming house.
           Bob Schieffer was rudely awakened from a sound sleep by his brother Tom. The urgent look in his brothers eyes stunned him.
           “Kennedy has been shot—you’d better get to work!” Tom shouted.
   Schieffer quickly threw on some clothes and reached for the snap-brimmed hat that made him look like a police detective. Then he hopped into his Triumph and sped downtown. On the radio he heard the terrible news—the president had been shot. Why did something like this have to happen, he thought, and why did it have to happen in Texas?

   Minutes dragged by. Lady Bird sat in a chair while Johnson stood. Neither spoke a word to one another. After a time, Secret Service agent Emory Roberts came in from visiting Trauma Room 1 and said that he didn’t think the president would make it. He and other agents urged Johnson to let them take him back to Air Force One where they could immediately leave for the safety of Washington.
   “No,” said Johnson. “I’m not leaving until I have more definite news of the president’s condition.”

    Oswald hustled past her without a word and went straight to his small $8-a-week room on the first floor. He returned a few moments later wearing a white zipper jacket over his work shirt. Roberts stared as he rushed past her again and out the door. She wondered why he was in such a hurry. She shook her head and returned to watching the grim events unfold on the television.
    Nellie Connally had never felt as alone as she did waiting outside the room where doctors were working to save her husband’s life. The doctors told her that John had been struck in the back. The bullet had penetrated his ribs and sent bone fragments into one lung before passing through his wrist and lodging in his left leg.

“HOW COULD A MAN SHOOT THE PRESIDENT OF OUR COUNTRY?!
Lyndon Jcknson
Aboard Air Force One, Dallas, 2:06 p.m.
President Lyndon Johnson took the oath of office aboard Air Force One.
    The air in the presidential plane felt close and hot to the new president. The air conditioning had been turned off and more and more people kept coming aboard. Johnson decided he should take the oath of office before leaving Dallas. Tradition dictated that upon the president’s death, the vice president automatically became president. But Johnson wanted to make sure everything looked official in the eyes of the world, especially the Russians, America’s Cold War enemy. He felt strongly that people needed to see physical proof that there had been an orderly transfer of power and that the government of the United States was stable.
    Johnson summoned Sarah Hughes, a Texas federal judge he had tried to help get appointed, to swear him in. Hughes, who had been at the Trade Mart waiting for the

"HOW COULD AMANSHOOT
Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas,
           Clint Hill looked on as Kennedys aides argued with the Dallas County medical examiner. The examiner was refusing to allow Kennedys body to be removed from the hospital without an autopsy. This, he insisted, was required in all homicide cases. The aides insisted that, since this was the president s body, an autopsy could be performed back in Washington. The two sides seemed at a stalemate. Finally, the medical examiner gave in, but only on condition that a medical professional stay with the body until the autopsy was completed. Admiral George Burkley, Kennedys personal physician, agreed to fill this role.
            Hill and several other agents and aides lifted the big, bronze casket into the hearse
59
       waiting at the emergency room entrance. Then Hill gently suggested that Mrs. Kennedy ride with him to the airport in a car behind the hearse.
   “No, Mr. Hill,” she replied, “I’m riding with the president.”
   Hill opened the back door of the hearse and the two of them joined Admiral Burkley and the casket, sitting on their knees for the ride to Love Field.
   Bob Schieffer, snap-brim detectives hat firmly on his head, was on assignment. He had been sent from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram newsroom to find out about a suspect in the Kennedy assassination who was being brought in. The man had pulled into a gas station in nearby Arlington and told the attendant he had heard on the radio that Kennedy had been shot. The attendant, who hadn’t heard the news, assumed that anyone who knew this had to be the shooter. He quickly called the police, who rushed down to arrest the man.
60
   All at once, the station door opened and several officers hustled in the accused man. Schieffer boldy stepped forward. He remembered a trick that the police had taught him that sometimes you can shock people into admitting the truth. So he confronted the suspect and asked him: “Why did you do it?”
   The man looked at him, stunned. “Well, I didn’t,” he replied. After questioning the man, the police decided he wasn’t involved, and quickly released him.
   The hearse pulled up to Air Force One. Hill and his fellow agents took out the casket and struggled up the steps of the portable staircase to the rear entrance. When they got to the top they found that the casket was too wide to fit through the narrow door. They broke off the handles and managed to jam it into the plane.
   All appeared to be ready for the swearing in. Someone told Hill that Mrs. Kennedy wanted to see him in the family cabin.
61
   As Hill entered, Kennedy took his hands in hers and looked deep into his eyes* “Whats going to happen to you now, Mr* Hill?’’ she asked*
   He couldn’t believe it* Here was a woman who had just seen her husband assassinated and she was concerned about his welfare* “I’ll be okay, Mrs* Kennedy,’’ he managed to say, his voice filled with emotion* “I’ll be okay*’’
     Merriman Smith and his two colleagues pulled up in the police car just as the casket was being loaded into the plane* At the same time, Judge Hughes’ car arrived* A short woman in her sixties wearing a brown dress with white polka dots, Hughes was ushered on board* Smith followed her* As he did so, he glanced down and suddenly realized he was missing something* “My God,’’ he muttered* “I’ve lost my typewriter*’’
      Dallas Police Headquarters, 2:30 p.m.
        On his arrival, Oswald had not been cooperative with the police. Now sitting in Police Captain Will Fritzs office, he decided to be more compliant. Fritz asked him why he had left his place of employment, the depository, at midday.
        “There was so much excitement,” Oswald answered. “I just thought that there would be no more work.”
        After a few more questions, Oswald asked if he could get a lawyer.
        “Not a problem,” said Fritz. “You can call one on the pay phone on the fifth floor, but you’ll have to pay for it yourself.”
“I don’t have any money,” Oswald said.
        “Then you can call collect,” Fritz said.
        While Oswald thought about this, Fritz asked if he’d be willing to take a polygraph test. Oswald refused and Fritz ended the interview.

Jackie Kennedy appeared white-faced but dry-eyed. She stood on one side of Johnson and Lady Bird stood on the other.
      Johnson, his right hand upraised and his left planted on a Bible, repeated the words after Judge Hughes: “I do solemnly swear ...” It was over in a minute. Lyndon Johnson had become the 36th president of the United States when Kennedy died, but now he had been sworn in.

He asked her where she lived and said he’d be right over to pick her up.
   But how was he going to get her to Dallas? It didn’t seem appropriate to pack her into his tiny two-seat Triumph. He went over to Bill Foster, who wrote about cars for the paper.

   As the big plane soared eastward, Merriman Smith tapped away at a White House electric typewriter. Alongside him Charles Roberts was also working on a story.

Then, he mentioned that he had just called Rose Kennedy,

   As he interviewed her in the backseat of the Cadillac, it quickly became apparent to Bob Schieffer that Marguerite Oswald wasn’t a very nice person. This is one of the most bizarre interviews I’ve ever had, he thought.
   Marguerite Oswald expressed no sympathy for either the dead president or her son. She only felt sorry for one person—herself. She told Schieffer that people would not feel sorry for her and that she would probably starve. She was convinced that her daughter-in-law, Marina, would get any money that came their way and all the public sympathy. Schieffer

knew this would make a great story for his paper, but that an even greater story could be waiting in Dallas—an interview with Lee Harvey Oswald.

 Aboard Air Force One, 4:35 p.:
   Lyndon Johnson could feel the tension building on the plane as it soared toward Andrews Air Force Base. In the back of the plane sat Kennedys loyal aides, crushed by the days events. In the front were Johnsons people, including Houston public relations executive Jack Valenti and Bill Moyers, former deputy director of the Peace Corps. The antagonism the two groups felt for one another was apparent, and nothing Johnson could say or do was likely to ease it. Johnson knew Kennedys people saw him as a grubby, classless politician who was unworthy of filling Kennedys shoes. But Johnson would do what he could to win them over. At least for right now, he needed them.

He gathered up their stories and brought them back to the little room, which fortunately had a telephone. He began calling the stories in to the Fort Worth news desk. He smiled, realizing that never once had anyone at the police station asked him who he was.

Now the surgery was over, and he had been taken to the recovery room. A doctor came in and said, “He’s going to make it,” and told her she could see him.
   The sight of her husband shocked her. He wore an oxygen mask and a sling on his right arm. There was a tangle of tubes coming out of different parts of his body. She bent down and kissed him gently. “How is the president doing?” he asked her.
   She avoided answering him. Later the doctors told her to keep Kennedy’s death from him until he was stronger. Finally, the next morning, when he asked again, she told him: “the president is dead.”

   Bob Schieffer s luck just kept getting better. When Marina Oswald was brought into the station, an officer asked if they minded Marina joining him and Marguerite in the room. “Not at all,” Schieffer told him. However, his attempts to interview Oswald s wife were frustrated because she appeared to only speak Russian.
   Now, as darkness settled in, Marguerite asked Captain Fritz if she could see her son. He agreed and led her, Schieffer, Marina, and an FBI agent to a holding room. In a few minutes, Oswald would be brought into the room and Schieffer would have the interview of his career. Just then, the FBI agent turned to him and asked, “And who are you with?”

  Dallas Police Headquarters, November 23, 1963, 12:00 a.m.
    Jack Ruby, wearing horn-rimmed glasses and clutching a notebook, entered the crowded basement of the police headquarters. Lee Harvey Oswald stood on a platform while a crush of reporters threw questions at him. Ruby, a regular at the station, had managed to sneak in.
    When the questioning ended and Oswald was led away, Ruby rushed up to the platform to greet a surprised District Attorney Henry Wade.
    “What are you doing here?” Wade asked.
    Ruby brushed it off as a foolish question.
 They all knew and liked him, the officers and detectives. He was a fixture there—regularly coming by to hand out cards for his clubs, offering free admission and drinks for police officers, bringing bags of deli sandwiches for the late night crew. Before Ruby left, he chatted with an old friend, Detective August Michael
Eberhardt. “Mike,” he said, “it is hard to realize that a complete nothing, a zero like that, could kill a man like President Kennedy.”

   It had been a 20-hour day for Lyndon Johnson. It was incredible to him that he had awakened that morning in Fort Worth as vice president and now was lying in his own bed in his pajamas as president. He had been talking from his bed for the past few hours to three of his aides—Bill Moyers, Jack Valenti, and Cliff Carter. He had gone over the agenda for the next day and used them as a sounding board. There was a lot to do. He would have his first meeting as president with Kennedy s cabinet members in the morning. He would then meet with Dwight Eisenhower, who had served as president for two terms before Kennedy. He finished talking and pulled up the bed covers. “Well, good night, boys,” he said. “Get a lot of sleep fast. Its going to be a long day tomorrow.”

      Hill and the Kennedy family members watched solemnly as members of the military carried the casket into the East Room. They placed it on a funeral platform, called a catafalque. Hill had learned that it was almost identical to the one on which the coffin of assassinated President Abraham Lincoln had been laid 98 years earlier. An honor guard was placed around the catafalque.
      Hill saw Jackie Kennedy and those closest to her go to the second-floor living quarters. Then he got into his car and drove to his apartment in nearby Arlington, Virginia. It was now 6:00 a.m. While his wife cooked him breakfast, he shaved, showered, and changed his clothes. After eating, he returned to his car and headed back to the White House for another long day.

   Abe Zapruder wasn’t pleased to see the man from LtJe magazine at his door. He had told Richard Stolley to come at nine, yet here he was, an hour early. But there was no point in sending him away. He would only come back again later. Zapruder was quickly learning that his film was something Stolley and many other representatives of newspapers and magazines wanted very much to get their hands on.
   So he invited the man in and had him sit down
beside two Secret Service agents who were already seated in the small, windowless room. Everyone was waiting to see the premiere of Zapruder s grim home movie. The FBI had learned of the film, got it from Zapruder, and had taken it to a lab the night before to get it processed.
   Zapruder now switched on the rickety projector and color images began flickering on the white wall. There was the limo. The first shot caught the president in the neck. Zapruder and his three guests watched, stunned, as they saw part of Kennedys head blown away by the final bullet. As one, the men groaned, sickened by the sight.
   Abe Zapruder now fully recognized the historic importance of his film. Because of it, he feared his life would never be quite the same again.

   Zapruder didn’t want to see his film exploited like that, yet he knew he had something of great value, something for which newspapers and magazines would pay a lot of money. Now here was Stolley from Life making him an offer for the film rights while a crowd of other reporters waited impatiently outside in the hall for their opportunity.
   Stolley initially offered Zapruder $5,000 for the film. Zapruder made it clear that, although he needed money to secure the future of his family, he wasn’t going to allow the film to be exploited. Stolley assured him that Life would not do that. As they talked, Stolley’s offer kept going up, until he offered $50,000 for print rights to the footage.
   “Let’s do it,” Zapruder said.
   They agreed to finalize a contract in the coming days. Then Stolley slipped out the back door, leaving Zapruder to face the angry crowd in the hallway.

    Ruby’s apartment, Dallas, November 24, 1963, 10:15 a.m.
        The shrill ring of the phone woke up Jack Ruby. It was 20-year-old Karen Carlin, one of the dancers at the Carousel Club. Carlin was calling Ruby for the third time to get an advance on her pay. Ruby was sympathetic. He knew she was four months pregnant and had a husband who couldn’t find work. She needed the money.
        He told her he would go downtown that morning and wire her $25 from the Western Union office. He hung up the phone, got dressed, and took one of his two pet dachschunds, Sheba, with him to the car. Ruby lived alone, had never married, and doted on his dogs like children. He drove off with $2,000 in cash in one pocket and his .38 caliber revolver in another.

        Captain Will Fritz was worried. Threats had been made against the alleged assassins life. He felt relieved when it was time to move Oswald from the city jail to the larger, less accessible county jail. He and Police Chief Jesse Curry planned for an armored truck to leave headquarters first as a decoy. After the decoy left, Oswald would be taken to a police car for the ride to the county jail. They hoped that reporters would take off in pursuit of the armored truck, thinking Oswald was in it.
        Finally, everything was set and in place. All that was left to do was bring the accused man down in the elevator to the garage and then outside to the car. Fritz gave the order.

     “Lee, if anybody shoots at you, I hope they’re as good a shot as you are,” Leavelle said.
     “Aww, there ain’t going to be anybody shooting at me,” Oswald said. Then Oswald and Leavelle got into the elevator and began their descent to the garage.

     The elevator opened and Lee Harvey Oswald stepped out with officers on either side of him* Only a few feet separated Ruby from the president s killer* At that moment a man Ruby had met earlier, New York radio reporter Ike Pappas, elbowed his way forward and thrust a microphone in Oswald s face* “Do you have anything to say in your defense?" Pappas asked*

       Before Oswald could speak, Ruby pulled out his revolver, took a step, and fired at Oswald’s stomach, crying, “You killed the president, you rat!” Oswald doubled up in pain. Ruby saw Pappas sink to his knees as if he himself had been shot.
       “There’s a shot!” Pappas cried into his microphone. “Oswald has been shot! Oswald has been shot!”
       In an instant a group of officers wrestled Ruby to the floor. “I’m Jack Ruby, you all know me!” he shouted.

       Clint Hill was with Special Agent in Charge (SAIC) Jerry Behn in the SAIC’s East Wing office when he got an urgent phone call. General Godfrey McHugh, President Kennedy’s Air Force aide, was on the line.
       “Clint, I’m in the mansion and we have a problem,” McHugh said. “You better get over here to the East

Room fast. Mrs. Kennedy wants to view the president.” Hill rushed over to find Jackie Kennedy in a black suit with a veil over her hair, standing by the East Room door with Bobby Kennedy. “Bobby and I want to see the president,” she said.
    Hill accompanied them inside and asked the honor guard to leave in order to give them some privacy. But Mrs. Kennedy said they didn’t have to leave. “Just have them move away a little,” she said.
    Hill and McHugh moved down the flag that was draped over the casket and opened the box. Then Mrs. Kennedy asked Hill to get her a pair of scissors. He fetched them from the usher’s office. After handing them over, Hill turned around and heard the sound of scissors snipping. He turned back. The Kennedys closed the casket and left. Hill returned the scissors. As he placed them in the drawer, he noticed, at the very tip, a strand of chestnut-colored hair. Mrs. Kennedy had gotten one last memento from her husband.

Just a few days earlier he had worked with other doctors and staff in the attempt to save President Kennedy’s life and now they were trying to do the same for his murderer.
    Saving Oswald would be a daunting task. The bullet had damaged his liver, spleen, and aorta. He was also bleeding internally, but the staff members intended to do what they could to save him.

       Special agent Behn had a problem and, evidently, he hoped that Clint Hill could solve it for him. Behn had heard that Jackie Kennedy intended to walk in the funeral procession on Monday. If she did, Behn told Hill, the many visiting heads of states and government officials would feel compelled to walk too. This would create a security nightmare for the Secret Service.
       “Will you please try to talk her out of it?” Behn pleaded. “You are the only one who even has a chance.”
       Hill said he would try and arranged to meet Mrs. Kennedy in the Treaty Room. When he asked her about her decision to walk she nodded. “I’ve decided not to walk all the way, only from the White House to St. Matthew’s.”
       He gently told her that many other people
   might decide to walk if she did.

         Agent Hill rode with Mrs. Kennedy and her brothers-in-law Bobby and Ted to the Capitol, where the president s casket lay in the Rotunda. The public viewing hours were supposed to have ended at 9:00 p.m. the previous day. But the turnout was so overwhelming that the viewing had been extended another 12 hours. By the time the Kennedys arrived, Hill heard that as many as 250,000 people had paid their respects. Hill stood by as the three Kennedys prayed beside the casket. Then an honor guard took the casket to the waiting caisson for the short ride back to the White House for the funeral.
         Arriving at the White House, they found a crowd made up of the diplomatic corps and 200 foreign dignitaries from some 100 countries.

   Rose Hill Cemetery, Fort Worth, 2:13 p.m.
     Marina Oswald felt that her husband s funeral had been turned into a circus. One hundred Fort Worth police officers had sealed off the cemetery to prevent curiosity seekers or troublemakers from interrupting the service. Marina Oswald couldn’t help but think that if security for her husband had been this tight earlier, he might still be alive.
     The police, however, hadn’t kept out the throng of reporters and photographers who stood about, staring and taking pictures of her, Marguerite, her two children, and Lee’s older brother, Robert— the only people here who she actually knew. She watched, dry-eyed, as several reporters, recruited to be pallbearers, carried the simple pine coffin
97
to the graveside. Then the head of the Fort Worth Council of Churches—another volunteer, since the designated minister never arrived—delivered a brief, simple sermon. When he finished, Oswald went up to the open coffin and took off her wedding ring. She tried to slip it on Lees finger, but it wouldn’t fit. So she gently placed it in the coffin and turned away. Secret Service agents escorted her to a waiting car.

   Soon after he arrived with the other mourners at the Kennedy gravesite, Agent Hill looked up and saw about 50 Air Force and Navy planes flying overhead. Then another plane’s sound was heard. The sound seemed familiar to Hill, the high-pitched whine of a perfectly tuned set of jet engines. It was Air Force One flying by low. Hill watched as the pilot dipped the plane’s wings in salute.
   After the brief ceremony, Mrs. Kennedy was handed a lighted torch and touched it to a gas-fueled
98
device, the Eternal Flame. She had asked for one just like the flame that burned at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Paris, France. As the flame shot up, she passed the torch to Bobby Kennedy and then to his brother, Ted.
    A bugler played Taps, the traditional ending to a military funeral. He flubbed one note, probably due to nervousness on this great occasion. Hill felt sorry for the bugler. He will never forget it, and the world has it recorded for posterity, he thought.

   The assassination of President Kennedy remains one of the darkest events in American history. It brought an end to a presidency that had captured the nations imagination and the adoration of many. The event was widely seen as the end of an age of innocence and idealism in American life.
   In addition, Kennedys assassination helped make television the media giant and news source it remains to this day. Before November 22, 1963, most Americans got their news from newspapers and radio rather than television. In the days after the assassination, televisions power grew. Suspending all regular programming through the president s funeral, the three television networks became the gathering place for a nation of mourners. Televisions in about 93 percent of American homes were tuned to the funeral. Millions also watched, stunned, as Lee Harvey Oswald was shot live on television by Jack Ruby.
   Lee Harvey Oswald was determined to have been the sole assassin of Kennedy by the 1964

Warren Commission. The commission was established by President Johnson to investigate the assassination. However, conspiracy theories that say Oswald did not act alone, or was set up for the murder, persist to this day.
   Marina Oswald married Dallas carpenter Kenneth Porter in 1965 and had a son with him. She continues to live in Rockwall, Texas, with her husband today.
   Marguerite Oswald died in 1981, not having spoken to her former daughter-in-law for years.
   Bob Schieffer was hired by CBS News in 1969. He enjoyed a long career, serving the television network as its chief Washington correspondent, anchor of the Saturday edition of the evening news, and the moderator of its Sunday news program Face the Nation from 1991 until his retirement in 2015.
   President Lyndon Johnson was re-elected for a full term by a landslide in 1964. Johnson was able to push through much of the legislation that Kennedy had proposed, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He also became embroiled in the Vietnam War.

    World War II (1939-1945) was truly a global war. It spread across 30 countries and involved more than 100 million people. It was also one of the deadliest conflicts in human history By the time it was over, an estimated 60 million people had died.
    World War II officially began in early September 1939. It was then that Adolf Hitler led Germany's Nazi Army in an invasion of Poland. The Nazis continued their invasion across Europe, brutally murdering more than 11 million people, including Jews and other ethnic groups. This mass killing of civilians by Nazi Germany became known as the Holocaust. By 1941 the Nazis had conquered and were in control of most of Europe.
    At the same time, Japan controlled most of Asia and was at war with China. The United States wanted to stop the Japanese but resisted getting involved in the war. Instead, together with Great Britain and the Netherlands, the United States froze Japanese assets, or items of value. As a result, Japan could no longer buy oil and fuel. Hoping to further weaken Japan's military, the United States also stopped exporting steel and iron to them. Japan's response was to form an alliance with Germany.

         After Pearl Harbor was attacked, the United States needed the help of as many recruits as possible. African-Americans wanted the chance to help defend their country. Thousands went to recruiting stations to sign up for the fight. However, the military, like much of the United States, was segregated. Black men were not allowed to serve in the same regiments as white men. A Limit was also placed on the number of blacks that could join the army and navy. Those who were allowed to join served in segregated regiments or worked as cooks and janitors on military bases.
         The United States also needed combat pilots to help fight in the war. Much of World War II was fought in the skies above Europe. Pilots would be needed to fly fighter jets and bomber planes.
         Many qualified African-American men volunteered to fly for the Army Air Corps. They experienced even more difficulty than the black men who volunteered for the army and navy. ALL Army Air Corps applications submitted by black men were rejected. Many military Leaders believed blacks were not physically or mentally fit to fly.

   African-Americans were disappointed in their country. The United States was fighting against racism in other countries, yet it ignored its own problems with racism. Black leaders decided to fight a "double war." In addition to fighting the Axis powers, they would also fight racism at home and around the world. At the same time, they were determined to prove they were just as qualified to be soldiers, pilots, and anything else, as white people.
   During World War II, segregation was widely accepted as a normal part of U.S. society. African-Americans were often treated unfairly and denied basic opportunities. For example, blacks had to use separate and inferior facilities. They were required to eat at different restaurants from whites, shop at different stores, attend different schools, and even use different toilets. African-Americans also had to sit at the back of buses and were pressured not to vote in elections. Some blacks were even kidnapped and murdered for expressing their opinions or standing up for themselves. Extreme white racists tried to create fear in the African-American community and keep blacks "in their place."

Even so, the men planned to fly it more than 3,000 miles (4,828 kilometers) to prove themselves as pilots.
   White and Spencer took off from Chicago on May 9,1939. Along the way they faced many unexpected challenges. When Old Faithful had engine trouble over Ohio, the pilots managed a bumpy landing in a farmer's field. They installed some new parts and continued on to Morgantown, West Virginia. However, the white crew at Morgantown's airport refused to allow the black pilots to park their plane overnight. The crew told them to refuel and Leave.

        Next, White and Spencer managed to follow a much larger plane to an airport in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. But they were immediately grounded for violating safety regulations meant to keep planes from colliding. Black politicians and the Legal team of the Pittsburgh Courier—one of the nation's top black newspapers—stepped in to help. With their aid, the charges were eventually dropped.

   White and Spencer knew the importance of their journey, and through it all, they never gave up. They eventually Landed in Washington, D.C., where they met Senator Harry S. Truman. He was impressed by the men's story and asked if they had applied to the Army Air Corps. The pilots explained that African-American applicants were always rejected. Truman seemed surprised and then asked to see Old Faithful. "If you had guts enough to fly this thing to Washington, I've got guts enough to see that you get what you are asking," Truman said. Truman soon sponsored a bill allowing black pilots to serve in the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP).

Chauncey Spencer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1906. After completing college he wanted to take flying lessons but could not find anyone willing to teach him in Lynchburg. Spencer was able to receive lessons in Chicago where he worked at a restaurant. He used most of his earnings for flying Lessons.

    The CPTP began in many U.S. colleges in 1939. Its purpose was to train civilians to become pilots. In the late 1930s, the U.S. Army only had about 4,000 pilots. Many more would be needed if the United States entered the war. But at the time, the army wasn't large enough to train all of these pilots. The CPTP was the solution to this problem.
    More than 1,000 colleges and nearly 1,500 flight schools participated in the program. The training was divided into 72 hours of ground-school classes and 35-50 hours of actual flight instruction. At the end of the program's first year, more than 9,000 military pilots had been trained. Thanks to Senator Truman, the CPTP became available to students at Tuskegee Institute beginning in December 1939. Tuskegee Institute

Tuskegee Institute, now known as Tuskegee University, is Located in eastern Alabama. It is the only college in the United States that is also a National Historic Site.
Tuskegee Institute was one of the first six black colleges to offer the CPTP.
About half of the 2,000 black pilots who graduated from the program trained at Tuskegee Institute. The CPTP ended in 1946.
   This partial victory was a huge step for African-Americans. They saw the CPTP as a way for them to eventually be allowed into the Army Air Corps. They hoped it would only be a matter of time before the U.S. military allowed black pilots to fly.
   All CPTP students were required to take a written examination. In March 1940 the exam was given to Tuskegee Institute's CPTP students. Every student passed. Their passing rate was the best in the South.

   African-American newspapers, such as the Pittsburgh Courier and Chicago Defender, demanded that blacks be accepted as military pilots. They also requested that the entire military be desegregated. African-American organizations and politicians believed in the success of a united military and nation. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) had made equal opportunity in the military one of its most important goals. They believed if African-Americans were allowed to fight in the military as equals, they would soon be treated as equals in all aspects of life.
   But many U.S. military officials believed black people were inferior to whites and would only hurt the military. Even the white leaders who agreed with the demands still said they could not change society. However, African-Americans refused to give up, and they continued to fight for their rights.

   The U.S. military faced increasing pressure from African-American organizations to accept blacks as military pilots. On January 16,1941, the U.S. War Department announced that an all-black squadron would be created within the Army Air Corps. However, they made it clear that black and white pilots and crews would remain segregated. ''Segregation is an established American custom," explained Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall. "Experiments within the army in the evolution of social problems are fraught with danger to efficiency, discipline, and morale." Many members of the military thought that black pilots would not be able to perform well in combat. The training of an African-American squadron was considered to be an experiment that would fail.

Hundreds of African-American men volunteered
                 for the new squadron. All volunteers had to take army intelligence tests. Most of the men were highly qualified college and CPTP graduates. Still, military officials were surprised so many did well on the exams. Top-scoring applicants moved on to Tuskegee Institute for five weeks of advanced flight training with the Army Air Corps. The men who successfully completed the training would become pilots in the U.S. Army. The training was difficult, but the black volunteers were more than ready for the challenge.
     "We'd all go down to the flying lines ... and stand before our instructors," said Aviator Cadet Louis Purnell. "The instructors would come out and tell you ... 'We are going up to 10,000 feet, and we'll perform loops and slow rolls.' You'd wait your turn, then you'd go up. Instructors would say very Little during instruction, but they were very strict. When you came down there was no exchange of words. He had a Little slip and so many errors would amount to a pink slip." If a cadet got three pink slips, he was dropped from the flight program.

    On March 7,1942, the first class of African-American pilots at Tuskegee Institute completed their advanced pilot training. Cadet Benjamin 0. Davis Jr. was among this remarkable group of men. Davis was a graduate of West Point, a well-known military academy in New York. After earning his wings, Davis was first promoted to captain. On August 22,1942, he became commander of the 99th Fighter Squadron—the first black flying unit in the American military. Additional squadrons formed as more pilots completed training. These men eventually became known as the Tuskegee Airmen.

    Benjamin 0. Davis Jr. was the only black cadet at West Point during his four years there. His fellow cadets refused to speak to him or share a room with him simply because of the color of his skin. However,
    racial discrimination never stopped Davis from achieving his goals. He continued to earn promotions throughout his career. In 1998 Davis became a four-star general—the military's highest rank during peacetime.
                More than 2,000 African-Americans completed training at Tuskegee Institute during the early 1940s. They studied hard and hoped to finally join the Army Air Corps, but they were still rejected. 'Applications from colored persons for flying cadet appointment or for enlistment in the air corps are not being accepted," said Major General E. S. Adams of the U.S. War Department.

We arc writing you hoping you may be able to give us cither and or information so as to hasten our transfer to the Air Corp. It seems with aviation playing the vital part it is we should have hardly any trouble getting in. Our papers arc in Washington awaiting disposition, as is the case of all Negro applicants. We hope you can help us. We close now awaiting your answer.

   By early 1943 the Tuskegee Airmen were ready and awaiting orders. The war raged across Europe and into North Africa, yet the black pilots were not sent into action. The U.S. Army held out, hoping more white recruits would become pilots. Meanwhile, the Tuskegee Airmen continued training and flew practice drills every day. At a flight show, Commander Davis told a crowd of people that his black pilots were performing as well as white pilots. "My greatest desire is to lead this squadron to victory against the enemy."

   The Tuskegee Airmen played an important role during World War II. They helped the United States free Europe and win the war overseas in June 1945. But their most important victory was the one at home. These men showed a rare form of courage as they battled racism in the military. Their dignity in the face of cruelty inspired America to change. In fact, Harry S. Truman, who became president in 1945, desegregated the U.S. military in 1948. It was in large part due to the black pilots who never gave up.

Liftoff!
    The space shuttle Columbia shook fiercely during takeoff on January 16, 2003. The seven astronauts aboard felt
their teeth chatter uncontrollably. Their bodies stayed strapped tightly to the seats. A liftoff was always a tense event. Space flight carried many risks. Mission STS-107 was no different. Even a tiny mishap could cause a huge disaster. Despite the risks, crew members were excited to spend the next several days in space.
    Eight minutes after liftoff, Columbia was in orbit above Earth. It seemed that
all had gone according to plan. What no one knew at the time was that a piece of foam had come off a fuel tank during takeoff. This would create a serious
problem for the shuttle. It would mean that the shuttle would not survive the
return to Earth.

    Engineers at NASA had been studying the foam breakoffs for years. Many of them believed foam strikes could be dangerous. If the debris hit a major part of the shuttle, it could cause serious problems.
    Others at NASA downplayed the problem. They said foam strikes had not caused serious problems in the past. Therefore, there was no need to worry about them now. They didn’t believe that something as light as a pillow could ever harm a spacecraft. As a result, nothing had been done to deal with the problem.

NASA and the Shuttle Missions
   NASA began the space shuttle program in the 1960s. The organization wanted to build a reusable spacecraft. Prior to the space shuttle, astronauts rode in capsules. The capsules traveled above powerful rockets. The rockets would separate from the capsules after takeoff. The rockets often burned up after separating. The capsules were not strong enough to be used again after returning to Earth.
   By 1971 NASA had a plan. It would build a spacecraft with reusable parts. The space shuttle consisted of four main pieces. A reusable orbiter housed the crew. Two reusable rocket boosters gave the shuttle power during takeoff. The external fuel tank was the only part not reusable. It burned up in the atmosphere after launch.
   After each mission the orbiter glided back down to Earth. It could carry up to seven astronauts. It also moved large equipment into space. Each shuttle had a lab. In this lab, astronauts performed experiments in space.

    Early missions had focused on space exploration. Columbia's 2003 mission, however, was focused mainly on scientific experiments for research.
    Some people later used the mission to argue against the shuttle program. They said shuttle flights were not worth the danger to astronauts. In addition, each mission cost millions of dollars. People objected to any mission that wasn’t absolutely necessary. They thought the money should be used for other programs.
   Columbia's crew completed more than 80 scientific experiments while in space. Some experiments involved studying the effects of microgravity on animals and insects.

THERMAL PROTECTION SYSTEM
   Spacecraft are exposed to extreme hot and cold during space travel. Columbia, like the other shuttles, was protected from these temperatures by the thermal protection system (TPS). A layer of lightweight tiles covered the orbiter. Without the TPS, the orbiter would not survive its return to Earth. However, the TPS could easily be damaged. When the foam hit Columbia’s left wing during liftoff, it harmed one of the TPS tiles. This allowed hot gases to leak into the left wing during reentry.

    Friday, January 31, 2003, was Columbia's last full day in space. The crew began planning for return to Earth. The first step was to bring the shuttle back into Earth’s atmosphere. The process was called reentry. Before reentry, many preparations took place. Some astronauts took turns practicing landing the shuttle with a computer. Others made sure the experiments were complete. They were excited about the results of their research.

  NASA informed the Columbia crew about the foam strike during flight. At the time, NASA did not know the great damage done to the shuttle. NASA workers sent an email to astronauts on the shuttle.

    Onboard the shuttle, crew members were laughing and enjoying themselves. They were anxious but excited to return home. Each crew member performed his or her assigned tasks. None of them noticed anything unusual. Pilot Willie McCool watched the shuttle glow in the extreme heat outside.
    “Looks like a blast furnace ... it’s really getting bright out there,” he said.
    Commander Rick Husband replied, “Yeah, you definitely don’t want to be out there now.”
    McCool and Husband were talking about just how hot the atmosphere is during reentry. At 2,000° Fahrenheit (1,093° Celsius), it’s about five times hotter than cookies baking in an oven.
    The shuttle traveled at 17,000 miles (27,000 km) per hour. It flew 40 miles (64 km) above Earth. The crew was unaware that very hot gases had started to enter Columbia's left wing. This was where the foam had struck. Mission control would soon see the first signs of trouble.

    In Florida the spectators and family members had no idea what was unfolding at mission control. But a few reporters had noticed something strange. A TV in a NASA building near the runway had been showing Columbia’s progress on a map. A glowing red triangle that had been marking the location of Columbia had stopped moving.
    At mission control Hobaugh tried to make contact with Columbia’s crew. But there was no reply.
    Hobaugh tried again at 9:03 a.m., saying, “Columbia, Houston, comm check.’ But he was met with silence.

In an early morning photo taken by Gene Blevins over Bishop, California, Columbia can be seen breaking up upon reentry.
   In California photographer Gene Blevins, looking through his camera lens, noticed that something was wrong. Turning to another photographer, he said, “Did you see that? Something just came off the shuttle!” The shuttle had begun to break up into smaller and smaller pieces, leaving streaks of light in its path.
   A spectator in Texas sent William Harwood, a reporter in Florida, a text message. It read, “The shuttle broke up!” When Harwood read the message, he felt a chill come over him.
    On the ground onlookers could see what was happening as they gazed at the sky. People in Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana made several calls to 911. They reported loud noises and lights in the sky. The lights could be seen without a telescope. These people were witnessing the Columbia breaking into pieces in the morning sky.

A part called an O-ring in a rocket booster failed during liftoff. Cold weather that day was the cause. All seven crew members aboard died. Space shuttle flights were stopped for the next 32 months. During this time, NASA redesigned some shuttle parts and made other changes. People were confident a tragedy like this would never happen again. The Columbia disaster proved them wrong.

    NASA quickly determined there could be no survivors. One of the board’s first tasks was to search for human remains. They would also search for the shuttle wreckage. These tasks would not be easy. The shuttle had broken up over an area that ranged from western Louisiana to central Texas. There were 500 square miles (800 square km) to cover.

recovery efforts. However, many reports of debris findings turned out to be unrelated to Columbia.
In 2011 a large chemical tank from Columbia was discovered in a lake about 160 miles (258 km) northeast of Houston. It had been there ever since the disaster eight years earlier. A drought In 2011 dried up the lake and exposed the tank.

The Columbia Reconstruction Project Team collected shuttle debris.
    Teams at NASA studied the wreckage. They laid out the pieces in the shape of the shuttle. They matched each piece to where it originally belonged on Columbia. Clues from the wreckage pointed to a likely cause. There was damage to the shuttle’s left wing. Engineers remembered the foam strike during liftoff. They brought this up again. Some at NASA still didn’t believe that a piece of foam could have damaged the shuttle so badly.
The wreckage from Columbia is now stored
The media were Invited just once to view the 84,000 pieces of debris. Now only researchers are allowed in the room where the debris is kept
Members of the media also doubted the foam harmed
the shuttle. Board member Scott Hubbard remembered the
reaction to this idea: “We had people in the shuttle program saying, ‘Oh, these guys are “foamologists!”’ They would hold a piece of foam up on national TV and ask, ‘How could anything this light do any damage?”’

    Members of the board made some calculations. They said the foam that broke off was likely traveling at 500 miles (800 km) per hour. This means the foam hit the shuttle with tremendous force.
    More efforts were made to show the harm the foam had
caused. Hubbard had a team build an exact copy of the shuttle’s
wing. The team used the same materials that Columbia was made from. An outdoor test was held on May 14, 2003, in San Antonio, Texas. TV crews, scientists, and some family members of Columbia’s crew were present.
    In the test, a large air gun fired a piece of foam at the model wing. The foam was the same size as the piece that hit Columbia. A wide hole was left in the wing. Hubbard and his team had shown the damage the foam strike caused during Columbia’s liftoff.

    The board issued a final report on the Columbia disaster on August 26, 2003. The problem with pieces of foam falling off the shuttle had been known for years. Why hadn’t the problem been fixed? The report criticized NASA for not solving the foam problem. It also pointed out other problems at NASA.
    The report stated that “practices [harmful] to safety were allowed to develop.” It also said that NASA put too much faith in past successes. This kept NASA workers from paying enough attention to possible danger. The report also said that NASA did not have enough funding and worked under too tight of a schedule.
The Columbia Accident Investigation Board speaks to reporters.
    The report said that NASA needed to search for and fix all safety problems. Better cameras needed to be attached to space shuttles. This would allow NASA to see more damage during liftoff. The report added that equipment needed updating and that space shuttles should eventually be replaced with more modern space vehicles.

   NASA administrator Sean O’Keefe responded to the report.
   “We have accepted the findings,” he said. He stated that NASA ‘will comply with the recommendations to the best of our ability.... The board has provided NASA with an important road map as we determine when we will be ‘fit to fly’ again.”
   Harold Gehman, chairman of the board, said that NASA “is not capable of safely operating the shuttle over the long term. That’s the bottom line.”
   The shuttle program was stopped for two years. During this time NASA redesigned the external fuel tank. It became much safer. NASA also updated other equipment and developed new safety procedures.
RESCUE MISSION
    During its investigation, the board asked scientists if Columbia's crew could have been rescued. They said it would have been possible while the space shuttle was still in orbit. The space shuttle Atlantis was due to launch soon after Columbia's return. Atlantis could have been prepared for an early liftoff. In space Columbia’s crew could have moved onto Atlantis. While this plan was not impossible, it would have been very difficult. It also would have been very dangerous. NASA would have had to skip several steps in preparing Atlantis for flight. There also could have been danger to Atlantis' crew.

   The report made an impact. President Bush said in 2004 that the space shuttle program would end within the next few years. The remaining shuttles would be retired after completion of the International Space Station. Later in 2004, Bush and NASA told of a new plan. NASA would replace the shuttle. The new spacecraft could take astronauts to the moon, to Mars, and beyond.
   “We do not know where this journey will end,” Bush said, “yet we know this: Human beings are headed into the cosmos.”
   In July 2005 the space shuttle Discovery lifted off on mission STS-114. This was the first mission after the Columbia disaster. Discovery’s crew tested new safety methods. Astronauts used cameras and a robotic arm to check the shuttle for damage. NASA also used more cameras to check the foam insulation during liftoff.
   Commander Eileen Collins sent a message to mission control. ‘We reflect on the last shuttle mission—the great ship Columbia—and her ... crew: Rick, Willie, Mike, KC, Dave, Laurel, and Ilan. We miss them and we are continuing their mission. God bless them and God bless their families.”

  With the blast of naval guns and the roar of tanks and planes, Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. This surprise attack marked the start of World War IL Germany, under its dictator, Adolf Hitler, wanted to expand its control over large parts of Europe. As Hitler won more territory, he ordered the killing of millions of people he considered inferior to Germans. Jewish residents of Europe were his top target, but Hitler slaughtered Slavs, Gypsies, and others as well.

    When the war began, the United States did not join the conflict. Many Americans still remembered the horrors of World War I. They did not want to take part in another war when the United States did not face a direct threat. But after Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, the United States declared war on Japan. That nation and Germany, along with Italy, were allies, and Germany and Italy soon declared war on the United States. President Franklin D. Roosevelt believed Hitler posed a huge threat to democracy and world peace. “FDR” welcomed the chance to fight Germany as well as Japan.
    When the United States entered the war, Germany controlled a large part of Western Europe, including France. The main fighting on the continent was in the east. In June 1941, Germany had invaded the Soviet Union, which stretched from Europe across the northern part of Asia. The United States helped the Soviets by sending supplies, but Soviet leader Joseph Stalin wanted something more. He wanted the United States and Great Britain to open a second front by attacking the Germans in France. That would force Hitler to move troops there from the Eastern Front, where the Soviets battled the Germans.

June 4, 1944, Southwick, England
Dwight D. Eisenhower
         General Dwight D. Eisenhower woke early as usual. He and his military advisors met daily at 4:00 a.m. to go over the weather forecast for Normandy, the Allies’ target in Operation Overlord. Eisenhower knew that he had only a few days during which he could give the order to begin the Allied landing on the French coast. Only June 4 through 7 would provide the low tides and full moon his troops needed to begin safely coming ashore.

that would fight in North Africa and Europe. After Allied successes in Africa and Italy, he was chosen to command the Overlord invasion. Eisenhower had never fought on a battlefield, but he had years of experience in training and organizing troops.
   Overlord required all his organizational skills, as the Allies amassed ships, planes, tanks, and troops for history’s largest amphibious invasion. Between the soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marines who would do the actual fighting and the military crews that supported them, Eisenhower commanded almost 3 million men. More than half were American, and most of the others came from Great Britain and Canada.
   Eisenhower had first hoped to begin the assault on France in May. He knew the Germans were building up their defenses along the Normandy coast. Adolf Hitler wanted to build the so-called Atlantic Wall all across Western Europe to try to prevent an Allied invasion. In France, the Germans brought in

attack. The 4:00 a.m. meeting to go over the forecast would be his last chance to decide if Overlord would begin the next day. Already, some vessels were at sea, preparing for the first phases of the attack. A storm, however, had settled over Normandy. Eisenhower heard chief meteorologist Captain J.M. Stagg explain the situation. "The clouds will be too thick for the planes to see their targets. And the seas will be rough, tossing around the landing craft supposed to bring the men ashore. It doesn't look good.”
   Despite the bleak forecast, one of the top commanders under Eisenhower thought the attack should go on. Another disagreed, while still another didn't take a strong position either way. The final decision, however, was Eisenhower's alone.

The men were silent as they prepared to go back underwater. The message meant that General Eisenhower had decided the weather was too bad to attack on June 5.

   Delaying the invasion had not been an easy decision to make. Eisenhower and his aides couldn’t be sure that the vessels already at sea could return to port and then be ready again to attack on June 6. Plus, the storm could get worse, and then that perfect time slot for launching Overlord would slip by. That would give the Germans even more time to ready their defenses.
   Waking up for another 4:00 a.m. weather report, Eisenhower heard fierce winds and pounding rains. He couldn’t imagine that Captain Stagg would have good news on the weather. At the meeting, Stagg confirmed that not attacking today had been a wise choice. The weather along the Normandy coast had been as terrible as he expected.

Stagg once again said that the next day looked favorable. Still, the commanders of the Allied air forces worried about the clouds. Once again, the final decision was up to Eisenhower. “I am quite positive we must give the order ... I don't see how we can do anything else." June 6, 1944, would be D-Day for the invasion of France.
            Late that night, Eisenhower recorded a message that the invading forces would hear before they left for France. He said, in part, "I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory!"

    ASSAULT FROM THE AIR
During World War II, both Allied and German forces used gliders to transport troops and equipment.

June 5, 1944, flying above France
   As midnight approached, Major John Howard sat inside a glider plane and thought about what could happen when he and his men reached France* He commanded six gliders, each carrying about 30 highly trained British soldiers* They would be the first Allied troops in France for Operation Overlord,
the first to most likely face German fire* Howard wondered: Would a machine gunner spot the gliders as they silently approached land? Would the gliders fly into “Rommels Asparagus"? Edwin Rommel, the German commander in Normandy, had put up telephone poles that were meant to rip off the wings of incoming gliders* Even without that “asparagus," the landing could be hard, perhaps injuring or even killing some of the men* A hard landing, Howard worried, might also set off the explosives his men carried with them on the planes*
   Howard was in Glider #1* The men on board it and two other gliders were supposed to seize a bridge over the Caen Canal* The Allies called it Pegasus Bridge* The men on the other three planes were targeting a bridge over the nearby Orne River* Howard s goal was to capture both bridges so the Germans could not send reinforcements to the beaches where British

and Canadian troops were supposed to land. Howard knew the bridges were well guarded. He hoped the element of surprise would let him and his men take the bridges without suffering heavy casualties.
    A few miles from the target, the bomber planes towing the gliders cut them loose. The gliders descended through the clouds. As they prepared to land, Howard and the other men in his glider linked their arms. Then they raised their feet, in case the floor was smashed during the landing. Howard could see the sweat on the pilot s face as he guided the glider down. The landing knocked Howard s helmet over his eyes, and for a second he could not see. Then he looked out and saw the bridge in the moonlight. Lieutenant Den Brotheridge led the men off the plane. “Come on, lads,” he said. He and his men, joined by the soldiers on the other two gliders, quickly took the bridge.
    Howard set up his command post near the three gliders. He soon received word that his men in the other three had also captured
22
their target. The mission had taken less than ten minutes. Now Howard s force would have to hold the bridges as the Germans realized what had happened and tried to retake them. Howard s men easily fought off a German patrol. But at 2:00 a.m., Howard saw a much more deadly force approaching his post. Two enemy tanks were only 100 yards away.

   Pluskat was still awake when he received a phone call at 12:30 a.m. "It seems the invasion is beginning," the voice from headquarters said. Pluskat rounded up two other officers, and along with his German shepherd, Harras, they drove to Pluskat s command post. It was a bunker built into the cliffs that overlooked the beach. Pluskat grew excited because he thought the invasion was finally coming. German commanders had thought the Allies would strike farther north, near the town of Pas-de-Calais. But perhaps Pluskat and his men would see real action too. Taking a pair of binoculars, Pluskat scanned the ocean in the moonlight. He saw nothing. Disappointed, he turned to his officers.

His job was to make sure the paratroopers on board the plane had all their equipment and got out of the plane as it came over its target. As the plane neared France, he wondered how he and the others would react when they faced enemy fire.
       Winters was part of the next wave of Allied troops to reach France after the gliders landed. More than 20,000 paratroopers would float down at various spots away from the coast. Their mission was to keep German reinforcements away from the beach and make sure the landing forces were not trapped before they could begin to push inland.

    Major Howard watched the two tanks slowly rolling toward the bridge. Howard asked one of his officers to bring out the only weapon the men
had that could stop a tank. It fired a bomb about one foot long. The job of actually firing it went to Sergeant Wagger Thornton. He and another soldier went to a spot near the bridge, waited several moments, then fired at the lead tank. Howard watched with joy as the anti-tank bomb hit its intended target. Several German soldiers jumped out of the damaged tank and the British soldiers killed them with their machine guns. The second tank quickly turned around. As the morning went on, British paratroopers landed nearby to reinforce Howard and his men. They faced no more major German challenges as they guarded the Pegasus Bridge.

   As the night went on, Hamel-Hateau and her family heard the sound of planes overhead* They were used to the Allied bombing raids in Normandy, but there were no military targets near their village, so it was unusual for the planes to be so close* The family went outside to investigate, but they didn’t see anything* They did hear the hum of more planes nearby*

His body was covered with large bags, and he carried a rifle and a pistol. Hamel-Hateau approached him and asked in English if his plane had been shot down. He said no, then replied in perfect French, “It's the big invasion.... Thousands and thousands of paratroopers are landing in this countryside tonight."
   The paratrooper asked if there were any Germans nearby and Hamel-Hateau said no. He asked if there was someplace where he could look at his map without using a light outside.

      Eisenhower put the failure letter in his jacket pocket, then went to another meeting on the weather* Staggs earlier forecast had been right; the weather looked like it was going to clear a bit* Of course, the weather didn’t really matter at this point* The Allies were committed to the attack on Normandy*

An estimated 28,845 British soldiers landed on Sword Beach
    For someone with no experience at sea, the water seemed particularly rough to Lieutenant Hugh Temple Bone of the 2nd Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment. The wind was whipping and the waves swelled as high as 30 feet. Bones regiment would be part of the first British assault team to come ashore at Sword Beach. It was one of three beaches assigned to British and Canadian forces, along with Juno and Gold.
    The regiment had boarded the Glenearn and Empire Battleaxe the night before at 9:00 p.m. These ships and others like them carried soldiers and the smaller landing craft that would bring them ashore. Bone was a signal officer, meaning he would be collecting and sending messages during the battle. Before leaving England for France, Bone had

collected any secret orders the men had and burned them, to make sure the Germans would not find them if any of the men were taken prisoner. Through the night, he wondered if he would ever see his girlfriend or his family again.
   Now, nearing the French coast at about 4:30 a.m., the first wave of marines and soldiers entered the landing craft. The men who would follow them cheered them on. Bone had blackened his face so he would be harder to see, and he put on an inflatable vest in case he ended up in the water. Then he waited for the order to go ashore.

   The choppy seas had made it hard for the men in Captain Joseph Dawsons regiment to board their landing craft. Most had to climb down nets cast over the side of the Henrico, the ship that carried them from England to France. Dawson commanded Company G of the 16th Infantry Regiment, part of the U.S. Army’s 1st Infantry Division. The division’s nickname was “the Big Red One.” Its members had fought during World War I and Dawson’s company had already seen action in Italy.
   By 4:45 a.m. Dawson and his men were in their landing craft and moving toward shore. During the trip to the Normandy coast, they could hear the huge guns from British and U.S. warships firing at the German defenses. Company G was heading for the beach the Allies had named Omaha. General Eisenhower and his aides knew the Germans had their

strongest defenses at this beach. Their artillery were set up high on cliffs above the shore, and they had also built defensive structures closer to the water.

Soldiers in the landing craft cheered as they watched the bombers head for their targets.

American troops in a LCVP landing craft approach Omaha Beach
   H-Hour for Company G was 7:00 a.m., just after the first wave of Americans hit Omaha Beach. Before any of the infantry came ashore, demolition teams would destroy the obstacles the Germans had placed in the water, and then tanks would go through the openings. Before that, though, Dawson and the others in the Big Red One faced a bumpy ride. Ocean spray soaked the men, and many hung over the side of their vessels, throwing up the breakfast they had eaten several hours before.

The shells shook the bunker and sent him to the ground. Dust from the concrete filled the air, and his binoculars were smashed. As the shelling continued, the phone rang. Someone at headquarters wanted to know the exact location of the shelling. “They’re falling all over,” Pluskat screamed into the phone. “What do you want me to do — go out and measure the holes with a ruler?”
   During a break in the shelling, Pluskat contacted all the crews manning his largest guns. The shelling and Allied

    For several hours, German Corporal Heinrich Severloh had sat in a concrete bunker above some sand dunes, a machine gun by his side. Barbed wire and mines guarded the entrance to the bunker. Severloh was positioned in Widerstandnest — “resistance nest" — 62. The nest was a series of bunkers connected by trenches, with ceilings 6 feet thick. Along with Severloh, 19 other men operated guns of different sizes. Resistance nests like these were built all along this stretch of the Normandy coast, and gunners like

Soldiers there would give the location of incoming enemy ships to large artillery batteries several miles away from the beach. Severloh and the others with him were part of Major Werner Pluskat s artillery of the 352nd Infantry Division.
   As daylight approached, Severloh saw an eerie sight in the distance — ships, a lot of them, of all sizes. As they approached the shore, Severloh heard the sound of airplanes drawing closer.

   Bullets and shells flew all around Seaman Second Class Ken Reynolds even before his landing craft reached the shore. As a member of the Naval Combat Demolition Unit (NCDU), Reynolds was one of 175 seamen now entering the water just off Omaha Beach. They were trained to blow up the metal obstacles that blocked access to the beach. Along with U.S. Army engineers, they were supposed to clear 16 paths 50 feet wide, so more landing craft could reach the shore. While Reynolds and others worked at Omaha Beach, NCDU teams and Army engineers were carrying out the same task at Utah Beach, the other target for U.S. forces.

He tried to ignore the dead bodies in the water around him and continue with his mission. He carried 32 small explosives that he was going to attach to the different obstacles. He had trained to blow up huge steel frames called Belgian Gates that formed a wall off the coast.

   The ride on the landing craft to Sword Beach was wet and bumpy. H-Hour for the 2nd Battalion was 7:25 a.m., and they seemed to be right on target. Normally Lieutenant Bone hated chewing gum, but now he worked over a piece in his mouth. When H-Hour came, he turned on his radio and began receiving reports from the men already battling on the shore: “Heavy opposition, pushing on.” “Heavy casualties, pushing on.” Bone heard the sounds of warfare too — the rat-a-tat of German machine gun fire and the explosions of their mortars.
   Approaching the shore, the landing craft bumped into an obstacle with a mine on top of it. “Just like in the photos they showed us,” Bone thought. Luckily, the craft didn’t hit the mine head on and set it off.

Both enemy and Allied artillery exploded all around the vessel, which finally reached the beach.
    As the doors opened to let out the members of the 2nd Battalion, Bone saw some of the soldiers around him fall into the water. Bone concentrated on keeping dry the radio set he would need to carry out his duties. He and some other men got the radio ashore and then began digging holes they could use for protection. Without looking up, Bone could tell that German bullets were hitting some of the British troops around him.
    Bone moved off the beach but then received an order to go back to the boats to round up men who had not made it far ashore, and to get more radio gear. Despite the battle raging around him, Bone was not afraid — he was focused on doing his job. But he couldn’t totally ignore the bloody bodies of dead soldiers and the cries for help from the wounded. Some of the casualties included members of his own radio team, whom he found taking cover behind a damaged tank. Further on, he saw some wounded soldiers who could still walk. Bone convinced them to help carry the radio sets still on the shore.

   When the first wave of American troops reached Utah Beach, General Theodore Roosevelt Jr. was with them. At 56, he was the oldest man in the invasion force, and he was
66
the only American general to come ashore in the first wave. Roosevelt was the oldest son of former president Theodore Roosevelt and a cousin of current president Franklin Roosevelt. The generals father had led a famous charge up Sanjuan Hill in Cuba during the Spanish-American War of 1898. Roosevelt Jr. had fought bravely during World War I, taking a German bullet to the leg. The wound and arthritis forced him to walk with a cane. But even with that old injury and heart problems, Roosevelt insisted on returning to battle after the United States entered World War II.
   He had also insisted on being with his men of the 4th Infantry Division when they stormed Utah Beach on D-Day. Before the attack, when Roosevelt made this request, his commander, General Raymond Barton, turned him down. Roosevelt, though, refused to give up. He wrote in a note to Barton, “It will steady the boys to know I am with them.”
   Roosevelts men began leaving their landing craft at 6:30 a.m. The general hated military
                  helmets, so he wore a cloth cap instead. Coming ashore with German shells flying through the air, Roosevelt was calm. He had his cane in one hand and a pistol in the other. But he sensed something was wrong. The landmarks in front of him on the beach were not the same as the ones he and the other officers had studied before the assault. Walking to nearby dunes, Roosevelt scanned the landscape. He realized that, somehow, he and his men had landed far from where they were supposed to. More men and tanks were coming ashore. Having landed in the wrong spot, they might be confused about what to do. But Roosevelt couldn’t risk trying to get them to their original landing spot under heavy German fire.
The general turned to a colonel nearby.
                  “We have landed in the wrong spot,” Roosevelt said, “but we will start the war from here.” Roosevelt’s radio wasn’t working, so he had to walk along the beach to give orders. He directed men and tanks as they came ashore as the shells exploded all around him.

From there, Bone watched as his fellow soldiers launched an assault on a larger German position. The Germans, though, were firing mortars, and Bone watched as men around him died in the explosions. With bombs bursting all around him, Bone could not run. And the ground was too hard for him to dig a foxhole that might provide some cover.

To one general reaching the scene he called out, “Keep right on the road, you’re doing fine!” German shells, though, still hit American targets. If one damaged a truck and it blocked the road, tanks quickly pushed it out of the way.

   But even with the killing Severloh and his fellow gunners had done, the Americans kept coming. Landing craft continued to hit the beach, and ships offshore fired at the German nests and bunkers. Severloh ran out of regular ammunition for his machine gun and began firing tracers. The colorful streaks they created in the air made it easier for enemy gunners to find his bunker. Shells from offshore began to land closer and closer.

At 8:00 a.m. he had reported to U.S. officials, “All preliminary reports are satisfactory. Airborne formations apparently landed in good order .. . Preliminary bombings by air went off as scheduled.” Later he learned that his men had come ashore on all five beaches.

        By 7:00 a.m., General Kurt Meyer knew his men would be heading into battle, he just didn’t know when. Meyer was in charge of the 12th SS Panzer Division. Panzers were German tanks that had caused so much destruction during the early years of the war, helping Germany achieve its first victories. Meyer belonged to the Waffen (Armed) SS, which had developed out of the private security force Adolf Hitler had created for his Nazi Party. The SS were the most loyal of Germany’s fighters and its members considered themselves an elite force. Meyer had already fought across Europe and earned several medals for his bravery.
        With the Normandy invasion, however, the panzer divisions faced confusion. Meyer’s was called the Hitlerjugend, or Hitler Youth. Its members were only 17 or 18 years old, but they had volunteered to go through rigorous
89
training because of their love of Hitler and Germany. Although the Hitlerjugend had never faced enemy fire, Meyer was convinced they were ready to fight. But his panzer division was one of several under

    Through the day on June 6, General Eisenhower visited other generals and continued to gather reports from the field. He met with General Bernard “Monty” Montgomery in his cabin, which had photos of enemy generals on the walls. Monty said the pictures helped him understand the Germans better. The British general had worked closely with Eisenhower in planning D-Day and was the commander of the ground forces still pouring ashore in Normandy. Eisenhower offered to have Montgomery meet with reporters and discuss the invasion — as much as the Allies could discuss an ongoing attack.
    Eisenhower also met with Lieutenant General Frederick Morgan. This British officer had helped plan the Overlord invasion even before Eisenhower became involved. Eisenhower reminded Morgan of all the hard

work he had done to make the invasion happen. “Well, you finished it," Morgan replied.
   By the evening, Eisenhower had a good sense of what the Allies had accomplished. More then 150,000 men were now ashore on the five target beaches. Some troops had been able to advance inland, but the Americans had not gained much ground at Omaha Beach. He learned about the men who had missed their targets, such as at Utah Beach, and that the Germans had more men at Omaha than his intelligence had predicted. He also saw that Caen was not under Allied control, as General Montgomery had hoped it would be. The different landing forces were also still far from one another. They needed to unite to march forward against the German counterattack still to come. Tomorrow, Eisenhower would go ashore at Omaha and see for himself the challenges the Allies still faced.

 Vick Winters
 June 7, 1944, Normandy, France
   To Lieutenant Winters and the other Americans on the ground in France, it was now D+l. Yesterdays fighting had been hard, but there was more to come. That morning, Winters received orders for Company E to lead their battalion in
97
the advance toward the town of Vierville. As they marched, they came under enemy fire. The battalion wiped out the enemy and took about 140 prisoners. Company E kept going, and with the help of two tanks took the village of Angoville. Winters and his men fought through the day and into the night. They were tired, after getting little sleep since getting the order on June 5 to prepare for D-Day. But they were ready to keep moving through France.
    As the lead enemy tank crossed the road, Meyer gave the signal for his men to open fire. Meyer soon saw that tank on fire from a German shell, and the crew scrambled to escape. Soon more enemy tanks were ablaze. The panzers quickly won the battle, and Meyers men began rounding up prisoners. He saw for the first time that they were fighting Canadians.
     Taking a motorcycle, Meyer rode out to watch another division of panzers still engaged in battle. As he rode in the open, Canadian tank shells began to fall around him. Finally, an explosion near him tossed Meyer from his motorcycle. As smoke from the exploding shells filled the air, Meyer found himself in a bomb crater — next to a Canadian soldier. The two enemies eyed each other closely, but soon their attention turned to the artillery and naval shells falling around them. Meyer s motorcycle was destroyed. He also saw German tanks not far away. He climbed out and ran toward them, while the Canadian ran in the other direction. Meyer made it to the tanks, and the fighting continued, as Meyer and his men tried to stop the advancing Canadians.

     The morning after D-Day, General Eisenhower traveled to Portsmouth and boarded the Apollo. The British ship was normally used
99
  to lay mines, but today it took the supreme commander and several U.S. and British officers to Normandy. The Apollo traveled through a lane that had been cleared of German mines, and more ships were looking for remaining mines. The Apollo finally reached Omaha Beach, and General Omar Bradley and his aide boarded the ship, along with several naval officers. Bradley was in charge of the 1st U.S. Army Group, though for now those men were under the command of General Montgomery. Once the Allies had total control of the landing areas, Bradley would take control of the group.
   From Bradley and his aide, Eisenhower learned more about the fierce fighting that had taken place at Omaha. The Americans were not able to move off the beach until 3:30 p.m., after facing stiff resistance from the Germans’ 352nd Infantry Division. Now, though, the Americans were several miles inland, and more men and supplies were landing on the shore.

       Eisenhower visited the British beaches as well and heard that things were going smoothly. The general never left the Apollo, as he welcomed the officers who had been on the battlefield onto his ship. During the various meetings, Eisenhower and his men heard Allied planes continuing their bombing missions, while naval ships fired at targets far from the shore. During the day and into the evening, Eisenhower heard four alerts that indicated German aircraft might be nearby. But none ever got close to the ship. The most challenging moment of the day came when the Apollo ran aground on a sand bar and Eisenhower and the other officers were forced to switch to another ship. Finally, around 10:00 p.m., Eisenhower returned to Portsmouth. He would have more important decisions to make the next day, and over the next weeks, as the Allies continued their assault on the Germans.

   The Allies also had some luck on their side on June 6. General Edwin Rommel, the commander of the German defenses in Normandy, was in Germany when the attack came. A skilled general, he could not personally direct the German response in the first day of the attack. The Germans also hesitated in sending tanks to the front, allowing the Allies more time to come ashore and move inland.
   Despite the success of D-Day, the Allies needed almost a week to close the gaps between the five beaches and then begin their breakout — the effort to capture more territory from the Germans and push them out of France. To keep men and supplies coming ashore, the Allies built portable harbors called mulberries. They sat just off the beaches and let supply boats bring in equipment from larger ships in the English Channel. The Allies needed to keep throwing more men and tanks at the Germans, who were beginning to launch a counterattack. It took until June 27 for the Americans to capture the port of Cherbourg.

         Meanwhile, the British and Canadians struggled to push the Germans out of Caen. In one of the atrocities of the war, German soldiers under the command of Kurt Meyer killed more than 20 Canadians they had taken prisoner.
             The fighting in northern France went on through the summer. Helping the Allies was the French Resistance. They blew up railroads and bridges to delay the arrival of German reinforcements. On August 15, the Allies launched a second invasion. This one came in the south, along the Mediterranean coast. In Operation Dragoon, the Allies faced much less resistance as they came ashore. They then worked their way north, to link up with the forces that had landed in Normandy. For the French, a highlight of the war came on August 25, when the city of Paris was finally freed from German control.
             As the Allies pushed east, the Germans launched a last major offensive in December. Fighting in the forests of Belgium, this came

             were advancing westward. Caught between the enemy on two sides, Germany finally surrendered. Eisenhower sent a brief message to Washington D.C.: “The mission of this Allied Force was fulfilled at 0241 local time, May 7th, 1945.”
                That victory would not have come if D-Day had failed. But skill and bravery, along with some luck, won the day for the Allies on June 6. Today, the memories of that day and the men who fought are preserved in cemeteries across Normandy and in museums in different countries. The first day of any important mission can be called a D-Day. But the world remembers one D-Day in particular, the Allies’ first step in taking down a brutal dictator and liberating France.

            America Joins World War n
          World War II (1939-1945) was a global war. It involved most of the world's nations. Powerful countries formed military alliances. These alliances involved more than 100 million people from 30 different countries. It quickly became the most widespread war in history.
          In 1937 Japan was at war with China and controlled most of Asia. The United States stopped exporting steel, iron, and aviation fuel to Japan. This was done to weaken Japan's ability to attack nations in the Pacific.
Soldiers working for the Japanese Army’s Radio Corps were specially trained to use radio equipment during World War II.

became so complicated that it took hours to translate simple messages. During combat delayed messages could be deadly. They needed a simple, yet unbreakable, code.
   Philip Johnston, an engineer from Los Angeles, read about the military's efforts to create such a code. He believed he had the solution. As the son of missionaries, Johnston grew up on a Navajo Indian reservation. He knew that a code based on the Navajo Language would be nearly impossible to break.

    Speaking Navajo
         In Navajo each syllable carries meaning and must be spoken perfectly. The slightest mistake in pronunciation or tone can change the entire meaning of a word. This makes Navajo one of the hardest languages to understand and speak. The Navajo Language even confuses other American Indian tribes.

Navajo homes are called hogans. They are made from wooden poles, tree bark, and mud. Hogans are similar to log cabins except they are round. The doors to hogans are always located on the east side so the sun can enter the homes in the morning. Each hogan has one room with a dirt floor. Many Navajo families have more than one hogan.

Navajo Indians lived under armed guard at Fort Sumner. Many tried to escape the terrible conditions. The Land was not good for farming, and there was a lack of clean water to drink. The only shelter some Navajo people had were holes they dug in the ground. The openings were covered with animal hides or branches for protection against the cold of winter and the heat of summer. More than 3,000 Navajo Indians died while being held captive at Fort Sumner.

The Navajo Indians have the Largest reservation in the United States. The reservation covers 27,000 square miLes (70,000 sq km) of Land.
The Navajo reservation is Located where Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado meet. This is why the reservation's location is known as the Four Corners.
         The U.S. government had treated the Navajo people unfairly for decades. However, this did not stop the government from asking Navajos for help during World War II. Marine recruiters were surprised to see the long line of Navajo volunteers willing to enlist in the U.S. military. At this point the code project was secret. The Navajo men had no idea what awaited them as Marines.

    The Navajo Indians were used to hard work and exercise.
They grew up Living off the Land—having to hunt, fish, hauL water, and build homes. It was the seemingly smaller requirements of boot camp that were difficult for the Navajo recruits. In many ways military expectations were at odds with Navajo traditions and culture. Navajo Indians often wore their hair Long. As Marines they had to wear their hair in short, military-style crew cuts. Navajos also believe eye contact is disrespectful. In the military it is a form of respect and discipline. Even wearing a uniform was uncomfortable for many of the Navajo men. However, all 29 Navajo recruits graduated from boot camp and went on to their next Level of training.
Fun Fact:
     The minimum age to enlist in the U.S. military is 18. However, some Navajo Indians Lied about their age to be accepted. One recruit was only 15 years old when he enlisted.

CREATING THE CODE

    The Navajo recruits were sent to Camp ELLiott in Southern California. There, they were finally told about the code project. The men were taught about basic electronics and how to communicate through radio broadcasts. They learned how to use, care for, and repair the radios that would eventually send their messages. But first they had to create the unbreakable code.
    "The brass came by and told us to use our language to come up with words representing the letters A to Z, and to come up with a code for military terms," explained Navajo code talker Chester Nez. "They put us all in a room to work it out and, at first, everybody thought we'd never make it. It seemed impossible because even among ourselves, we didn't agree on all the right Navajo words." Despite the difficulty of this task, the men worked together and soon created the perfect code.
                                                                   Tools

    The Navajo men then took it a step further. They used three words to represent each English letter (A=apple, ant, ax). They used the three words interchangeably to make the code harder to interpret. The Navajo translation for the letter A was now coded as be-la-sana, wol-la-chee, or tse-nill. For example, to communicate the word "navy" over the radio, the men would say the Navajo code word for each Letter—n, a, v, y (nesh-chee, wol-la-chee, a-keh-di-glini, tsah-as-zih).
Navajo code talkers Preston Toledo (left) and Frank Toledo (right) were cousins. Preston Toledo was only 18 when he joined the Marines. With his small size, he did not weigh enough to meet the Marine's requirements. To solve this problem, he drank a large amount of water before enlisting to add extra pounds to his weight.

    Thankfully not all words had to be spelled out and coded letter-by-letter. The Navajo men compared the military to nature and chose words to represent common terms. Fighter planes flew quickly Like hummingbirds, so they were given the Navajo code name da-he-tih-hi. Battleships were compared to whales and were coded Lo-tso. Submarines were besh-lo, meaning "iron fish." The United States was coded ne-he-mah, which means "our mother."
    The Navajo men practiced sending and translating the code over the radio. They trained until they could send and translate three-line messages in 20 seconds without any mistakes. The slightest error could change the entire meaning and put troops in danger.
                               When the Navajo Marines were creating their code, they named planes after different types of birds. According to one of their Legends, while trying to escape an enemy tribe, Navajo Indians prayed to their gods for help. The ground Lifted up beneath them and turned into a giant bird that carried them to their current home in the Southwest.
                               When the bird landed, it turned into the giant rock mountain known as Shiprock, which is located in New Mexico.

Iwo Jima lllllltlllllllllllllllllllllll
   Iwo Jima is an island belonging to Japan. It was the location of a key February-March 1945 battle during World War II. During the battle six code talkers worked day and night to send more than 800 messages without a single mistake.
The code worked exactly as Philip Johnston and the Marines had hoped. U.S. troops received important messages, and enemy ears could not understand any of the radio broadcast. This helped the United States capture Iwo Jima and eventually win the war. The Navajo men were "the simplest, fastest, and most reliable" way to send secret messages, wrote Marine Captain Ralph Sturkey in his Iwo Jima battle report. The Japanese never broke the Navajo code and surrendered in August 1945.
Were it not for the Tlavajo, the Ttlarines would never have taken J?wo kima.

    The Navajo code talkers were not allowed to talk about their experience when they returned home. Their code was classified. The Marines wanted to keep it a secret in case they needed to use it again in future battles. Very few people knew about the Navajo code talkers and the role they played in winning World War II. Instead they quietly went back to their lives on the reservation.
    In 1969 the military officially released the secret code. After that, the story of the Navajo code talkers spread across the country.
In 1982 President Ronald Reagan declared August 14 National Navajo Code Talker Day. In April 2000 New Mexico Senator Jeff Bingaman proposed an act to honor the code talkers. The act's purpose was to recognize the code talkers' heroic actions during World War II.
The unique service they provided to the United States saved countless Lives and helped to end the war. Later that year President Bill Clinton signed the act into law.
