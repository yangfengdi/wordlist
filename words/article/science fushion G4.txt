In this lesson, you;ll read about how scientists do their work. Active readers look for main ideas before they read to give their reading a purpose. Often, the headings in a lesson state its main ideas. Preview the headings in this lesson to give your reading a purpose.
The Role of
Scientists
It’s career day for Mr. Green’s fourth-grade class! Mr. Green invited a scientist named Dr. Sims to talk to the class. The students are ready, and
they have many questions to ask.
Active Reading As you read these
two pages, turn the heading into a question in your mind. Then underline the sentence that answers the question.

nThank you for inviting me to your school! My name is Dr_ Sims, and I am a scientist A scientist asks questions about the natural world. There are many kinds of scientists and many questions to ask!
Science is the study of the natural world. Earth scientists study things like rocks, weather, and the planets. Physical scientists study matter and energy. Life scientists, like me, study living things. I am a wildlife biologist, which means I study animals in the wild.
Scientists work alone and in teams. Sometimes, I travel alone on long hikes to watch animals. At other times, I ask other biologists to go with me. I share ideas with other scientists every day.
Science is hard work but fun, too. I like being outdoors. Discovering something new is exciting. The best part, for me, is helping animals. The best way to explain what a scientist does is to show you/’
For each area of science, write a question a scientist might ask.

Scientists make observations about the world around them. An observation is information collected by using the five senses.
Scientists ask questions about their observations. Notice that Dr. Sims' questions are about the living things in the classroom. That’s because she is a wildlife biologist Your questions might be different if you observed different things than she did.
Dr. Sims asks, nHow would you find an answer to my question about the goldfish?” She and the students talk about watching the fish. Someone suggests writing

A Fair Test
An experiment is a fair test. It can show that one thing causes another thing to happen. In each test, you change only one factor, or variable. To be fair and accurate, you conduct the experiment multiple times.
To test something else, you must start a new experiment. Being creative and working in teams can help scientists conduct experiments.

ask a question
form a hypothesis
plan and conduct an experiment
record and analyze results
draw conclusions

any science questions cannot be answered by doing an experiment Here’s one question: What kind of lizard have I found? This question can be answered by using an identification guide. Here's another question： What causes the sun to seem to rise and set? This question can be answered by making and using a model of Earth and the sun. Here's another： At what time of year does a state get the most rain? This question can be answered by looking for patterns through many years of rainfall records. Here's another： How did people who lived 100 years ago describe Mars? This question can be answered with research. Research includes reading what others have written and asking experts.

Scientists Share Their
Results as Evidence
Dr. Sims says, uTell me something you know/5 You tell her that it is going to be stormy tomorrow. She says, uHow do you know???
Active RMdinqi As you read these two pages, draw two lines under the main idea.
When scientists explain how things
work, they must give evidence. Evidence is data gathered during an investigation. Evidence might support your hypothesis, or it might not. for example, think about the class with their lizard. The students tell Dr. Sims a hypothesis： Lizards eat more insects than fruit. They carry out an experiment, putting tiny crickets and
fruit in the lizard's tank. After two hours, they observe how much food is left, and then repeat the experiment each day for a week.
The students tell Dr. Sims that their lizard ate more crickets than fruit. She says, uWhat is your evidence?"The students share their recorded results. They report that the lizard ate 13 crickets and no fruit.
We used thermometers and found that when the air temperature changed by 5 degrees, a chameleon’s skin color changed.
Evidence
We measured the temperature at the same time each morning and afternoon for one month. Each day, the air temperature was higher in the afternoon than in the morning.

Scientists infer how things work by thinking about their observations. A biologist may infer that the color patterns offish enable them to blend in and avoid predators.
Scientists may observe many things, such as changes in color, temperature, and bubbling

dentists use inquiry skills every day and so do you. When you observe, you use your five senses to get information. Let's say you smell cheese, bread, and spicy odors. You inferl think we are having pizza for lunch today!” An inference is a statement that explains an observation.
When you think about how things are the same and different, you compare them. For example, your family wants to adopt a new kitten. You compare different kittens, looking for one that is playful and friendly. When you decide which kitten is the best, you communicate that decision to your family. You can communicate by speaking, writing, and by using pictures or models.
Compare
Scientists compare objects and things that happen.
C
t
► Practice the skill of comparing. List ways these two fish are similar and different.


Scientists use these skills every day in their
investigations. Find out what they are and
when you might use them.

Scientists use their observations
and existing research to make
predictions about what will happen
in the future. For example, a meteorologist

uses weather patterns to determine

whether it will rain over

will change?”That one thing is a
variable. Let's say you want to find out
how cold a freezer has to be to make
fruit pops. The variable that you will
change is the temperature
inside the freezer.

Recording Data
he bits of information you observe are called data. Some data are in the form of numbers. For example, the number of butterflies you see in an hour is a piece of data. Other data are in the form of descriptions. Examples include written notes, diagrams, audio recordings, and photographs.
Displaying Data
The data you record as you investigate may be correct, but not easy to understand Later, you can decide how to display the data. For example, you might use your scribbled notes from the jungle to draw a map showing where you saw each butterfly. You might compare the number of each kind of butterfly you found in a circle graph.
Only observations are data. So when you You might use a bar graph to show the think, 'There are more butterflies here than number of butterflies you saw each hour, in Canada,” that’s a guess, not data.

You see on the news that the number of honeybees in the United States is decreasing. What is happening to them? How do scientists use data to solve problems and
share information?
Drawing Conclusions
C ommunicating

You've recorded your data. YouVe displayed it in a way that is easy to understand. Your next step is to analyze, or look for patterns in, the data. You might identify a trend, or a direction in the data over time. For example, you might conclude that the number of honeybees in your hometown has decreased by 30% in the last five years. What's next?
Scientists communicate in many ways. They may work together to collect data. They compare their data with other scientists doing similar investigations.
They report their results and conclusions by giving talks and writing reports. Conclusions often lead to new questions to investigate. Scientists are still studying why the number of honeybees is decreasing.

Drjohn Diebold spent much of his life studying Earth's oceans. He worked in the lab and in the field. He studied volcanoes, ancient ice sheets, and faults that cause earthquakes under water Dr. Diebold improved the design of the air gun, a tool used to make underwater sound waves. Then he used these sound waves to make 3-D pictures of the ocean floor.

Dangerous weather can happen suddenly. Hurricanes，tornadoes，floods，and winter storms can harm people, pets, and homes. How can models save lives?
IVMi
Data from Space
Satellites circle Earth 24 hours each day. Images and other weather data are beamed back to Earth. It's called real-time data because scientists see the pictures almost as soon as they are taken. In this image, a hurricane sits along the coast of Florida. The colors are not real. Scientists choose them to show differences in wind speeds, heights of clouds, and other factors
sing Models
Meteorologists use satellite data to make computer models of weather They model hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunderstorms The models are used to predict how and where storms will get started.
Getting the Word Out
Weather reporters also use models. They make two-dimensional maps for TV and Internet viewers to see. The maps can change to show how fast and where bad weather will be.
This weather model shows the height of the clouds of a storm.
What Can We Do?
You can use models to help your family be prepared for dangerous weather. Draw a diagram of your home in your Science Notebook. Label the exits. Does your family have a safe place to meet in an emergency? Where is it?
How can your model help you in an emergency?

For scientists, a model represents something real that is too big, too small, or has too many parts to investigate directly. Scientists use models to investigate and understand the real thing. Several kinds of models are used in science. Two-dimensional models, such as drawings, diagrams, and maps, have length and width. Three-dimensional models have length, width, and height.
Computer models are computer programs that behave like the real thing. Some models, such as models of storms, can be used to save lives.
Main Idea： Models in science are like real things and are used to understand real things.
Detail: Two-dimensional models are flat, like a map or a diagram.

The design process starts with identifying a need or a problem. Next, you brainstorm and write down ideas on how to plan and build a potential solution. Once you have some options, select a solution to try. Usually, engineers test possible solutions using a prototype.
A prototype is an original or test model on which a real product is based. If the prototype works, then the real product is made. Usually, after testing a prototype, improvements have to be made. The prototype is then tested again. Finally, a finished product is made.
Desig
Even something seemingly simple takes a lot of thought, planning, testing, and
improvement.

Look around you at all the things you use every day. Do you have ideas about improving them?
Active Reading As you read these two pages, find and underline
the meaning of the word prototype.
The first step in any design process is identifying a need or problem. Is there a chore that could be easier, a tool that could work much better, a car that could go faster or be safer? Often, the design process begins with the phrase ”What if?"
A prototype is a test version of a design. To build a prototype, a person has to have plans. Early sketches give a rough idea. More detailed drawings provide exact measurements for every piece. Keeping good records and drawings helps to make sure that the prototype can be replicated.

Now that the prototype has been built, can the final product be far behind? Yes, it can. But it might not be. It all depends.
Active Reading As you read these two pages, draw a box around the clue word or phrase that signals one thing is being contrasted with another.
Test
and Improve It!
rototypes are carefully tested. This
testing helps answer questions
such as, Does it work the way it should?
Is it easy to use? How does it hold up
under normal working conditions?
The first prototype you build
may pass all its tests. If so,
the prototype can go into
production. However, it is
more likely that testing shows that the
design needs to change. Once the test
results are analyzed, it’s back to the
drawing board. The product may need
only a few minor improvements, or it
may need to be completely redesigned.
If a prototype works as expected.
it will become a finished product.

邊M
Redesign and Share
When a prototype fails to meet a design
goal, it may be redesigned. Redesign takes
advantage of all work done before. Good
design features are kept, and those that
fail are discarded.
When the final working prototype is
done, team members communicate the
design. Sketches, blueprints, and test data
and analysis are shared. Often, the product
details are recorded in a legal document
called a potent.

echnology is constantly changing. Anyone can invent or improve a technology product or process. It takes new ideas and knowledge for technology to change. The goal of any new technology is to better meet people's needs. However, new technology can also bring new risks.
Changes in technology often involve making things safer, quicker, easier, or cheaper. For example, people once used candles and lanterns to light their homes.
These things helped people see at night, but they could also cause fires. Electricity and incandescent light bulbs helped solve this problem, but this technology also has its risks.

How
few
than 310,000 types of plants on Earth! How
do scientists group all of them?
Active	As you read these two pages, circle the two
types of plants that are being compared each time they appear
dentists classify plants into two groups： nonvascular plants and vascular plants.
Nonvascular plants are the simplest types of plants that grow on land. These small plants grow close to the ground and soak up water and minerals like a sponge. Some parts of nonvascular plants look like structures on vascular plants, but the functions are different. For example, nonvascular plants have parts that look like roots, but the parts don't take in water. Instead they help anchor the nonvascular plant in the ground. Nonvascular plants don't have stems or leaves, either. Instead they have a stalk on which leaflike structures grow.
Most plants that you see every day are vascular plants. Vascular plants have a system of tubes that carry water and nutrients through the plant These tubes run through the plants roots, stems, and leaves. Roots take in water and minerals and also anchor the plant in the ground. Stems hold up the plant’s leaves, which make food for the plant.
All plants that produce flowers/ such as rosebushes and magnolia trees, are vascular plants. Flowers are reproductive structures, but not all vascular plants have flowers. Some vascular plants, such as pine trees, produce reproductive structures called cones.

m
Vascular plants, such as this
rosebush, have roots, stems, and
leaves. Water and nutrients taken
in by the roots move through the
stem to the leaves in tubes. The tube

system also moves food from the
leaves to other parts of the plant.

Vascular plants have tubes that work

Active Reading As you read this page, draw two lines
under the main idea.
ascular plants have structures called roots.
Roots are usually underground and absorb water
and minerals from soil. If you have ever helped weed a
garden, you know that roots also help anchor a plant
in the soil. There are two main types of roots—fibrous
roots and taproots.
Fibrous roots are thin.
branching roots that
grow close to the surface.
Grasses and most trees
have fibrous roots.

106
w
Taproots are thick, strong
roots that grow deep in
the soil. Some plants use
taproots to store food-
When you eat a carrot
or a beet, you are eating
a taproot!


Stems are structures that have tubes
to carry water, sugar, and minerals to
different parts of the plant Stems also
support the plant Stems may look very
different. Most plant stems grow above the
ground, but some plants have stems that
remain underground.
There are many types of stems. Some
plants, such as trees, have a single hard
woody stem called a trunk. Shrubs have
many smaller, woody stems. Soft green
stems support other plants, such as daisies.
► Compare and contrast fibrous roots
and taproots.

growing season. Many plants with soft stems

Leaves can be long, short，wide, narrow, smooth, rough, shiny, or dull. Some leaves even have fuzzy surfaces!
Active	As	you	read	the	paragraph
on this page, underline two facts about leaves.
Leaves are another part of vascular plants. Leaves are plant parts that use sunlight to produce sugar for the plants food. While leaves may have the same function, leaves come in many shapes and sizes. Some plants, such as water lilies, have round leaves. On other plants, such as redbud trees, the leaves are heart-shaped. Grasses have leaves that are long and narrow. Leaves can even be triangular, as they are on a gentian sage plant
► Scientists often use leaf shape to identify plants. Label each leaf shape.
108
Vascular plants, such as maple trees, have leaves with veins.


Leaves also have different textures. Tomato plant leaves have tiny hairs on their surfaces that make them look and feel fuzzy. These hairs may keep the tomato plant from drying out and protect its leaves from animals. Other leaves, such as an aloe leaf, feel smooth and waxy. The waxy coating keeps the plant from drying out. Can you think of a plant with shiny leaves?
If you look at a leaf, you may see veins running across it. These veins are small tubes that carry food made by the leaves to the plant’s flowers, stems, and roots. Veins also carry water and minerals through the leaves. When the veins are filled with water, they even help support the leaves!
► Leaf veins are usually almost symmetrical, or are nearly the same on both sides of the center line. Draw the missing veins on the leaf, based on the part that has veins.

lants make their food through a process called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants
use energy from the sun to change carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen. Photosynthesis takes place
in the leaves of plants. A substance in the leaves called chlorophyll captures energy from the sun during the day. Chlorophyll is what makes leaves appear green in color. It also helps plants make sugars, which the nts store in their stems, roots, and in some plants, Iheir leaves.
v Carbon dioxide is a gas that plants get from the air. Plants take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and

give off oxygen. This oxygen becomes part of the air
that you breathe. These two gases move through small openings in a plant's leaves.

hen a plant grows, it goes through a series of set stages. The series of stages that a living thing goes through as it develops is called a life cycle. It is important for people to understand plant life cycles, because most of the food we eat comes from plants.
Most plants grow from seeds. First, a seed is placed in soil, so it can sprout. Next, the plant grows until it reaches maturity. A mature plant may grow flowers or cones. Then these structures make more seeds. You will learn about flowers and cones on the next pages.

Flowers and cones are reproductive structures that make seeds. They produce sex cells. Sex cells are used during sexual reproduction. Male sex cells are called sperm, and female sex cells are called eggs. Fertilization is the process of a sperm and an egg cell joining together. A fertilized egg grows into an embryo inside a seed.
About 1,000 types of plants produce seeds in cones. In plants with cones, sperm are made in male cones and eggs are made in female cones.
Most plants produce seeds in structures called flowers. In plants with flowers, grains of pollen, produced in parts called anthers, contain the sperm. Eggs are made in a structure called a pistil. Many flowers have both anthers and a pistil. As you can see in the picture, flowers have many other parts as well.

lants reproduce through pollination.
Pollination is the process of pollen
moving from a male plant part to a female
plant part. There are several ways this can
happen. Sometimes wind can blow the pollen
from one plant to another, which is how
many grasses and trees are pollinated.
Other plants are pollinated by pollinators.
Some bees, birds, butterflies, and other
animals are pollinators, for example, a
butterfly goes from flower to flower drinking
nectar At each flower, the pollen on the
stamens rubs off on the butterfly. When
the butterfly visits the next flower, the
pollen may drop off and fall on the pistil.
As a result, the flower will be pollinated.

A spore is a cell that can grow into a new plant when the conditions are right. Some plants, such as mosses and ferns, grow from spores instead of seeds. Plants that grow from spores have two distinct forms in their life cycles.
Spores are released when the structures that hold them break open. Wind carries the spores to new places. If a spore lands in a good spot, it will grow into a plant

Life in Full Circle
Like plants, animals have life cycles. Animals are
born and then begin to grow up. When animals
become adults, they may have young of their
own. In this way, life continues to renew itself.

ost animals reproduce sexually. During sexual reproduction, sperm from a male joins an egg from a female. The fertilized egg can then develop into a new animal.
In some animals, such as many kinds offish, eggs are fertilized outside of the female's body. In other animals, such as birds, eggs are fertilized inside the female's body. After the eggs are fertilized, birds lay the eggs. Bird parents then protect the
eggs until they have hatched.
After the young are born, they begin to grow and change. Over time, newborns develop into youths. Youths continue to develop until they grow into adults. Adult animals mate with one another to produce offspring. An animal's life cycle ends when the animal dies. However, the animal's offspring will likely have offspring of their own. In this way, the life cycle repeats again and again.

Eggs
n many animals, the young look similar to the adults. But in other animals, the young look very different. In complete metamorphosis [met*uh_MAWR_fuh*sis], an animal goes through four different stages in its life cycle. The egg hatches into a larva. The larvae [LAR*vee] of many insects look like worms. A larva develops into a pupa [PY〇o*puh]. The pupa of a moth is enclosed in a cocoon. While in the cocoon, the pupa develops into an adult moth. The adult splits its cocoon and flies out.
Some insects, such as dragonflies and termites, go through a different series of changes. In incomplete metamorphosis, an animal goes through three different stages in its life cycle. First, the animal hatches from the egg as a nymph [nimf]. Nymphs look like tiny adults, but they don't have wings. As the nymph grows larger, it molts. Molting happens when an insect sheds its hard outer skeleton. After several moltings, the insect, which now has wings, reaches its adult stage.

Saving the
Sea Turtles
Some kinds of animals are endangered. That means there are not many of them left. Scientists study the life cycles of endangered animals to try to save them and help them increase their numbers.
(c'ea turtles are one example of an endangered animal. Hunting, ^pollution, and beach erosion have caused the number of sea turtles to go down. To help sea turtles, people have learned about the sea turtle's life cycle. They have used what they learned to rear sea turtles.
The turtles are then released into the wild. Over time, scientists hope this will help increase the number of sea turtles.

To rear sea turtles, eggs are collected.

:
When the eggs hatch, the young turtles are cared for until they can be released into the wild.
► Examine the graph. It shows the change in the number of leatherback sea turtles in the Pacific Ocean. Why do you think it is important for humans to try to rear sea turtles?
When the turtles are ready, they are taken to a beach and released.

• What is an animal behaviorist?
，An animal behaviorist is a scientist.
I study an animal's behavior, or how it responds to its environment. In other words, I research how animals act.
• Why do animals act the way they do?
• Animals are born with some behaviors. These behaviors are called instincts. Birds migrate, or travel, when the seasons change. Ground squirrels hibernate during cold weather. Animals communicate using sounds or movements. These are all instincts.
Do animal behaviors change as the
animal grows?
Some animal behaviors are learned. These behaviors change with experience. In the wild, mothers teach their young to hunt. People train animals as pets, as performers, and m as companions. Training animals takes time.

^The environment consists of all the living I and nonliving things in an area. Look at the picture on these pages. The environment shown here includes the animals, plants, water, soil, air, and everything else in the picture. Animals and plants depend on their environment to meet their needs. For example, the zebras in the picture get food, water, and shelter from their environment.
Earth has many types of environments. For instance, Arctic environments are very cold; tropical rainforests are very hot Some types of environments are deep in the ocean. Others are on dry land with very little rainfall. Because there are so many types of environments on Earth, there are also many types of living things.

A physical adaptation is an
adaptation to a body part. Living things have different physical adaptations based on their specific environments.
For example, plants and animals in open spaces have different physical adaptations than living things in forests.
In open spaces, grasses can bend in strong winds. Grassland animals have coverings to blend in with the grass. These animals may be able to run fast or have shoveMike paws for burrowing. Living things in forests have physical adaptations to live in and around trees. Vines can climb up trees to reach sunlight they need. Many forest animals can grip branches.
This blue jay’s curved feet help it grip small branches. Its wings enable it to fly from branch to branch.
Compare the prairie dog's grassland adaptations with the sloth’s forest adaptations.
This sloth's long claws help it to hang from tree branches for most of its life. A sloth can even sleep without letting go of the branch.

en

magine you live in a constantly flowing stream of water. How could you stay in the same part of the stream without being carried away? Many fish that live in streams have smooth bodies and strong tails.
These characteristics help fish swim against the current. Water plants have flexible stems that allow them to bend with the flow. Many water insects are able to hold on tightly to water plants. Other insects burrow into the soil at the bottom of the stream.

off, though, the piece can sprout roots and start to grow in a new part of the stream.
c

Plants in still water, such as ponds and lakes, have different adaptations. Some plants are tall and have strong stems, so they can grow above the water. Others, such as water lilies, float on the surface.
Animals that live in lakes and ponds are excellent swimmers. Many are adapted to living in deep water with little light. Catfish have whiskers that sense chemicals in the water to help them find food in the dark. Some birds wade at the shore and hunt. Their long, thin legs look like the cattails, so fish do not see them until it's too late.

Deserts are places that get very little rain. Some deserts are very hot. How do plants and animals live in such hot, dry places?






Atfivc	As you read these two pages, circle the words or phrases
that describe desert environments.
f^esert plants and animals have physical adaptations that help them stay cool and conserve water. Many desert plants have waxy coatings on their stems to minimize water loss. Many of these plants have very long roots to reach water that is deep underground. Some desert plants have wide root systems that can	I
absorb lots of water when it rains. Desert animals have physical adaptations to keep cool. Some have short, thin fur, or no fur at all.


A behavioral adaptation is something an organism does to help it survive. For example, most desert animals are active at night to avoid the heat of the day. An instinct is a type of behavioral adaptation.
An instinct is an inherited behavior an animal knows how to do without having to learn it. For instance, jackrabbits stay crouched in one position whenever they sense danger This instinct helps them hide from predators.
Other behaviors help organisms survive in the desert. For example, some seeds of desert plants stay dormant or inactive, until it rains. When it rains enough, the seeds grow quickly into plants that flower and make more seeds.

Saguaro cactus flowers open and release their fragrance at night and close the next day. It is cooler at night in the desert. As a result, the flowers do not wilt as quickly as they would during the day.

Active Reading As you read these pages, circle
the words or phrases that describe polar environments.
Temperatures in Antarctica rarely get above freezing—even in summer! Plants and animals that live there have adaptations to live in extreme cold. Emperor penguins have a thick layer of fat—a physical adaptation that keeps them warm on land and in the water To protect themselves from very cold winds, male penguins huddle together in large groups. The behavior is an instinct that helps male penguins and their newly hatched baby penguins keep warm.
160
The Arctic has extremely cold winters and very short summers. Arctic animals have thick fur and a layer of fat to keep in body heat. Some Arctic animals are often white in the winter, which helps them blend in with the snow. These characteristics are physical adaptations, Arctic animals also have behavioral adaptations. For example, many Arctic animals live in dens dug into the ground or snow during very cold months.
Most Arctic plants have short roots because the ground there is frozen the majority of the year These plants produce seeds during the short summer when the ground isn't frozen. Most Arctic plants grow close to the ground, which helps protect them from strong, cold Arctic winds-

Coral reefs are made up of the outer skeletons of coral animals. These reefs are home to many types of organisms.
II of the living and nonliving things in an area make up an environment The living things in an environment include people, plants, and animals. The nonliving things include water, air, soil, and weather. All of the living and nonliving things in an area and their interactions make up an ecosystem [EE.koh.sis.tuhmL
An ecosystem may be as large as a lake or as small as the area under a rock. Ecosystems are found everywhere organisms live and interact—in water or on land. Some ecosystems include coral reefs, savannas, swamps, rain forests, and the polar ecosystems.

African savanna

Look at this picture.The zebras, the elephants, the grasses, and the shrubs—in fact, all the living things shown—form a community. A community is made up of all the organisms that live in the same place.
Natural and human activities change communities over time. On the savannas of Africa, for example, water is scarce during the dry season. As a result, many organisms die. Fires are also common. Lightning causes most of these fires; however, people start some, too.
Fires kill some organisms, but many more survive. Grasses have deep roots
that are not harmed by fire. Some trees have thick, fire-resistant bark- Moles, gophers, and other small animals stay away from fire by hiding underground. Larger animals, such as zebras, antelopes, lions, and hyenas, run fast to escape fire.
Spring thunderstorms bring the rainy season to the savanna. Grasses, shrubs, and trees grow back quickly. Animals that survived the fire give birth to their young. With so much grass to eat, the mothers are able to make enough milk to feed the calves, and the animal populations grow.

A population is a group made up of the same type of individuals in the same ecosystem. Antelopes might live in the same community as elephants. But antelopes make up one population, and elephants make up another
Populations change due to natural causes. If spring rains do not fall, grasses in the savanna will not grow. Without enough food, some animals and their young will not survive.

Water, air, sunlight, and presto, dinner is served! Plants are able to use water, air, and solar energy to make their own food. Read these pages to learn how other living things get their food.
Active RMdinqi As you read these pages, circle the words that signal details.
Gray mold covers these strawberries. As the mold breaks down the fruit, it returns nutrients i back to the soil for the M plant to use.	m
► What could happen if too many consumers were competing for the same food source in a habitat?
Any living thing that makes its own food is called a producer. Trees and algae are types of producers. Animals can’t make their own food, but they need energy, too. An animal that eats plants or other animals to get energy is called a consumer
Afield of strawberry plants may provide energy for many organisms. For example, consumers, such as birds, opossums, mice, squirrels, and people may eat the plant’s fruit. Deer, rabbits, and insects may prefer to eat the plant's leaves.
Consumers often compete for food in their habitats. When there is too much
competition, some organisms die. For example, if there are too many rabbits in a habitat, they all won’t have enough food to eat. Some will die, and the rabbit population will decrease. In time, when the plants they eat grow back, the rabbit population may grow larger again.
An overripe fruit, a falling leaf, or a dying strawberry plant provides energy for another group of organisms called decomposers. A decomposer is a living thing that breaks down wastes and the remains of plants and animals for energy. Fungi and bacteria are two types of decomposers.




You open a bag of bread and right away your nose detects a musty scent. You see greenish-blue dots
in the bread and think, (<Yuck}
Usually, finding mold growing in our foods in not a pleasant experience.
Yet mold and other decomposers play important roles. Molds, mushrooms, and yeasts are types of fungi. Fungi and bacteria are the main types of decomposers.
Decomposers help recycle materials in ecosystems. When an organism dies.
/
decomposers go to work. Fungi and bacteria produce chemicals that help them break down and absorb nutrients from dead organisms and wastes. As decomposers feed, they release useful materials back into the environment Plants use these materials to grow. When these plants die, the decomposers go to work again.

Changes in Food Webs
Imagine that one animal disappeared. What would
happen to the other living things in the food web?
Active Reading As you read these two
pages, circle clue words that signal a detail such as an example or an added fact.

Changes in food webs can affect all parts of a food web. For example, suppose the weather was very cold in the spring. Only a few plants in a meadow might live through the cold spring. This means that the mice in the meadow would not have enough to eat. Their numbers would go down. The snakes in the meadow eat mice. Their numbers would also go down. The hawks in the meadow hunt snakes and mice. The hawks would be hungry, too.
Now suppose that the spring was warm and wet. Many plants would grow in the meadow. The mice would have plenty to eat. Their numbers would go up. The snakes and hawks would also have plenty to eat, so their numbers would go up, too.
Populations in Yellowstone National Park

This harmed the trees. Since beavers had fewer trees to build dams with, the beaver population decreased. After the wolves were reintroduced to the park, both the trees and beavers began to thrive.
Food webs can be disrupted when one member of a food web goes away. This happened in Yellowstone National Park. During the early 1900s, the gray wolf was hunted in the park. Eventually, no gray wolves were left.
The gray wolf preyed mostly on elk. The number of elk in the park increased after the wolves disappeared In 1995, scientists returned 14 gray wolves to the park. The number of wolves has since increased. As a result, the number of elk in the park has

Some natural resources, such as water and air, are used again and again. Other resources form quickly in nature and are easy to replace. If a tree is cut to make paper, a new tree can be grown in a short time. The new tree will replace the old tree. Natural resources that can be replaced quickly are called renewable resources. Scientists also consider sunlight and wind renewable resources.
People need to use renewable resources wisely. The wise use of resources is called conservation [kahn^ser^vAY^shuhn]. Why is conservation important? People can use up renewable resources. Think about this： What would happen to fish if people ate more fish than could be replaced? Soon there would be no fish left!
Ilonrenewable
Not all natural resources can be replaced quickly. Some natural resources take thousands or millions of years to form.
Active Reading On these two pages, circle
phrases that show how nonrenewable resources are different from renewable resources.
atural resources that aren't replaced easily are called nonrenewable resources. It can take thousands or millions of years to replace a nonrenewable resource. Fossil fuels are an example of a nonrenewable resource. Coal, oil, and natural gas are all types of fossil fuels. Some are used to produce electricity- Some are used to run planes, cars, and other vehicles.
Because they form so slowly, there are limited amounts of fossil fuels and other nonrenewable resources. Once nonrenewable resources are used up, they cannot be replaced in our lifetimes. If people keep using fossil fuels at the same rate they use them today, these fuels will be gone very soon.

Soil takes hundreds of years to form.丨t is made of weathered rock and once庸living plants and animals.
Soil is a nonrenewable resource that people use to grow crops. It can be washed away if it is left uncovered or used improperly. As a result it is important for people to conserve soil.
Minerals and rocks are other types of nonrenewable resources. A mineral is a nonliving solid with a crystal form.
A rock is a solid substance made of one or more minerals. A rock that contains a valuable mineral is called an ore. Many minerals and rocks, such as limestone and aluminum ore, are mined. Once they have been removed from a mine, there are none left. It takes a long time for more minerals or rocks to form.
Limestone and aluminum are mined. Limestone is used to make cement, and aluminum is used to make cans.

Every state has natural resources. Many natural resources are found in greater quantities in some parts of the United States than in others. Trees, silver, wind, coal, and fish are just a few examples of natural resources found in the United States.
People mine land to get many natural resources. Some mining is done to get valuable minerals, such as silver, iron, and copper Mining also takes place to get fossil fuels. Other mining gets rocks used to construct roads and buildings.
Sometimes land is used for food production. Ranchers raise cattle that graze on the land. Dairy farmers use land to raise cows that provide milk to make cream and cheese. Soil is also used to grow crops, such as corn, avocados, and oranges.
Some land is used to produce green energy, or energy generated using renewable resources. Wind farms, solar cells, and hydroelectric dams use wind, sunlight, and water to produce electrical energy.
Forests, or areas with large numbers of trees, provide lumber. People use lumber to make paper and furniture and to build houses.

The Mississippi River watershed is an important natural resource. It is home to many living things.
214
From its source as a tiny stream in
northern Minnesota to where it empties into the Gulf of Mexico, the Mississippi River spans 3,782 km (2350 mi)_ Along the way, it connects with hundreds of rivers and streams, including the Missouri and the Ohio Rivers.
Water from 31 states drains into the Mississippi River. All of this water makes the Mississippi River system one of the world's largest watersheds. A watershed is all of the land and water that drain into a river system.
A watershed is an important natural resource. States often share the water in a watershed. Virginia, for example, shares the water in the Chesapeake Bay watershed with five other states as well as the District of Columbia.
The rivers and streams in a watershed are used in many ways. For example, the Mississippi River supplies drinking water to more than 50 cities. People also use water from the Mississippi River to grow crops, for recreation, and for transportation.

Keepta It Clean
Using up natural resources too quickly is a problem. Another problem is pollution, or harmful materials in the environment. Pollution is harmful to natural resources. How can you help to conserve natural resources and prevent pollution?
Pollution can harm air, water, and soil. It can also harm plants and animals.
Many communities have cleanup projects to make the environment healthier for everyone.

Reasons to Recycle
What happens to trash? It ends up in a landfill, which is wasteful. Many things we throw away can be reused For example, some things, such as paper, glass, plastic, and metal, can be recycled and made into new products. By reducing, reusing, and recycling we help conserve natural resources.

r environment is made up of living and living things. Things that make up the natural environment include the air we breathe and the water we drink. They also include the living and nonliving things that people and animals use for shelter. The natural environment is the source for all the natural resources that organisms need to stay alive.

Animals and plants make up the
living part of the environment.
Organisms get what they need
from the environment.
Mountains, valleys, rivers, and oceans make up the nonliving part of the natural environment Different parts of the environment support different types of organisms. Some trees can only grow near the top of a mountain. Others can only grow near the valley floor Environmental factors, such as temperature, moisture, and availability of food, may affect where an organism can live. Some organisms can only live in the water. Others can live both in the water and on land.

People clear forests to make lumber and to make space for new roads, buildings, or homes. Plants die when a forest is cleared The animals that live in the forest must move to find new homes. If they don't find another habitat that meets their needs, they might die.
Sometimes people introduce nonnative plants and animals to the environment. These invasive species have no natural enemies to control their population and can be very destructive. The kudzu plant and the emerald ash borer beetle are two nonnative organisms. They have invaded ecosystems in various regions of the United States, killing millions of trees.

About three-fourths of Earth’s surface is covered by water Most of the water is stored in oceans. Water moves between Earth’s surface and the atmosphere through a process called the water cycle.
The sun provides the energy for water to move through the water cycle. Sunlight heats up water particles near the ocean's surface. It causes water to evaporate.
Evaporation is the change from a liquid to a gas. When water evaporates, it forms an invisible gas called water vapor.
Water vapor rises into the atmosphere. The atmosphere is the mixture of gases that surrounds Earth. In the atmosphere, water vapor cools to form clouds. At any time, about three-fifths of Earth's surface is covered by clouds.
1J ecipitatiun
What Goes Up
Comes D〇wn
What happens to water vapor after it rises into the air? How does it become puffy white clouds or raindrops that fall on your head?
Active Redding As you read these pages, write numbers next to the sentences and phrases that show the order of events from evaporation to precipitation.
Condensation
Think again of the ocean. Water from the ocean’s surface evaporates. As water vapor rises into the atmosphere, it cools. When water vapor loses enough energy, it condenses to form liquid water. Condensation is the change ofa gas into a liquid.
There are tiny solid particles in the atmosphere. Water vapor condenses around these particles to form water droplets. A few water droplets are almost too small to see. However, when billions of droplets are close together, they form clouds.
Clouds can be made of water droplets, ice crystals, or both. They can form high in the sky or just above the ground. Fog is a cloud that forms near the ground.
Water vapor condenses around salt and dust particles in the air to form these water droplets.
Water vapor may condense on cool surfaces, too. It’s why the cool glass below seems to ’’sweat. Dew is water droplets that form on objects near the ground.
248
Water droplets in a cloud collide and join together. It takes many droplets to form a single raindrop.
Precipitation
Air currents keep water droplets in the air. But as droplets and snow crystals grow inside clouds, they become too heavy and fall to Earth as precipitation. Precipitation is water that falls from clouds to Earth's surface. Rain, snow, and hail are all forms of precipitation.
Precipitation that falls into the oceans may quickly evaporate back into the atmosphere. Precipitation that falls on land may be stored, it may flow across the land, or it may be used by living things. Depending on where it falls, water from precipitation may move quickly or slowly through the water cycle.

Not all of the water that falls on land evaporates right away or seeps into the ground. Runoff is water that cannot soak into the ground and instead flows across Earth's surface. Too much precipitation may cause runoff Runoff often flows into streams, rivers, and lakes. It may also flood
low-lying areas.
Precipitation that falls in cold places may become part of a glacier. A glacier [GLAY^sher] is a large, slow-moving mass of ice. Water can be stored in glaciers for a very long time. Eventually, though, glaciers melt. Meltwater from glaciers can form lakes, flow into oceans, or become groundwater. Melting glaciers can increase the amount of runoff in a place.
When glaciers melt, they quickly release stored water. Some of it may evaporate, some may seep into the ground, and some may move across the land as runoff

hen you turn on a faucet, water flows out. Where does it come from? People can get fresh water from rivers or lakes. They can also get fresh water from aquifers. An aquifer [AH*kwuh®fuhr] is a body of rock that stores groundwater People can drill into an aquifer and pump the water to the surface.
The water in aquifers can run low if people use more than can be replaced by precipitation. Human activities can also pollute aquifers. States that share aquifers work together to find solutions to these problems. They want to make sure there is enough fresh, clean water for everyone.
The Floridan Aquifer covers about 60,000 square kilometers. Billions of liters of water are pumped out of the Floridan Aquifer each day. Large cities, such as Savannah and Orlando, get water from this aquifer

A gentle wind can be pleasant, cooling you off

_-——
he sun warms Earth's surface unevenly.
This uneven heating causes differences
in air pressure. Air moves away from areas
of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure
similar to how water flows downhill. This
movement of air is called wind.
Areas near Earth’s poles receive less
sunlight than areas near the tropics. At the
poles, the air is cold and has higher pressure.
As a result, air moves along Earth s surface
from the poles toward the tropics. At the
tropics, air warms, rises, and moves toward
the poles. These winds, called global winds,
blow over large areas of Earth. They move

Local winds move short distances and can change direction. Daily changes in temperatures can cause local winds to change direction. For example, at night, the mountainside cools quicker than the
valley below. The wind at night blows from the mountainside to the valley floor. In coastal areas, daily temperature changes result in local winds known as land breezes and sea breezes.
Sea Breeze
During the day, land heats up more quickly than water.
Air over the land also warms, causing the air pressure to drop. Cooler, higher 緩 pressure air flows from over the water to the land, forming a sea breeze.
Land Breeze
At night, land loses heat more quickly than water. As the air over land cools, the air pressure rises. Cooler, higher-pressure air flows from the land toward the sea, forming a land breeze.

How Clouds rorm
Some clouds signal precipitation. Others signal fair weather. How can you use clouds to predict weather?

flL As you read these pages, circle the three types of clouds.

ir often has some water in it Most of the time you can't see the water because it is an invisible gas called water vapor. Clouds form as water vapor cools and condenses. A cloud is made up of tiny water droplets and ice crystals； these are so small that air currents can hold them up. A water droplet can be thousands of times smaller than a raindrop!
There are three main types of clouds. Cumulus clouds are white and puffy and are common on clear, sunny days. Under the right conditions, cumulus clouds can develop into massive thunderstorm clouds. Cirrus clouds look like white streaks and are high and thin. Cirrus clouds usually signal cool, fair weather. Stratus clouds are low and gray, making the day dark and gloomy. These clouds can produce or signal incoming rain or snow.

You might not think about rain—-unless there is too much or too little of it. What causes precipitation?

As you read this page, underline the cause of precipitation and circle kinds of precipitation.
Rain
recipitation forms when water particles inside of clouds grow too large and fall to
Earth's surface. Rain, snow, freezing rain, sleet
and hail are common kinds of precipitation.
Rain may start as ice crystals that melt as they fall to Earth's surface. Snow forms when water vapor changes directly into ice. Freezing rain occurs when falling, super-cooled raindrops do not freeze in the air but instead freeze when they strike objects near the ground.
Sleet is made of small lumps of ice. It forms when rain falls through a layer of freezing air. The raindrops turn to ice before hitting the ground
Hail is made up of layers of ice. The layers form as air currents inside a thunderstorm cloud repeatedly lift and drop a hail particle. Each up-and-down trip adds ice to the particle. A ball of hail can be smaller than a pea or larger than a grapefruit!

Many factors affect the kinds of precipitation that falls in a place. For instance, snow falls in places with cold winters. It also falls in places with very high elevations. In contrast, hail might fall
anywhere and at any time of year. It may even fall in places near the tropics!
People depend on precipitation to meet their water needs. Too much or too little precipitation can be a problem.

Too much precipitation can cause rivers to overflow. Floodwaters can damage crops and homes.
Too little precipitation is a drought. Droughts can cause the ground to dry out and plants and animals to die.

he forecasters have a lot of help! Meteorologists, or scientists who study weather, collect data from all over the world. They use automated systems at sea, on land, in the air, and in space to help track the weather.
At sea, weather buoys collect data on coastal weather conditions. These data help keep people in coastal cities safe. On land, weather-monitoring stations track weather conditions in remote locations. They can send advance notice about incoming weather. Scientists also use Doppler radar towers to observe how storm clouds are moving.
Weather balloons and weather satellites collect data from high above Earth's surface. Weather satellites can track the weather over very large areas. They also help relay data from land-based tools to meteorologists around the world.

One day, it is so cool outside. The next day, it is warm enough to wear shorts. What happened to the weather?
Active RMiling As you read these pages, underline the definition of an air mass. Circle four characteristics that air masses may have.
ackets of air move across Earth's surface. An air mass is a large body of air with the same temperature and humidity throughout.
An air mass reflects the conditions of the place where it forms. Air masses that form over land are dry.
Air masses that form over water are moist. Cold air masses form near the poles, and warm air masses form near the tropics.
As air masses move across an area, they can collide. The boundary between two air masses is called a front. Weather changes take place at fronts. For example, as a warm front passes over an area, warm air replaces cooler air and the temperature rises. The movement of air masses and fronts explains why you might be chilly one day and warm the next. At a front, stormy conditions are common.

Meteorologists use maps to show the current weather and how it will change. What does it take to make a weather map?
Active Reading As you read these two pages, put a star [*] next to the main idea of each paragraph.
Most weather forecasts are accurate within five to seven
days. A weather forecast is a prediction about the future weather conditions of a place. Weather forecasts beyond seven days are not very accurate.
Meteorologists forecast the weather based on the local weather data and observed weather patterns. They analyze the air temperature, humidity, and air pressure data of a place. They also analyze weather patterns, such as the movement of air masses and fronts, to prepare a weather forecast. In North America, air masses and fronts generally move from west to east.

Weather forecasts help us plan each day. When severe storms strike, weather forecasts can also help save lives.
echnology has changed how we measure, analyze, forecast, and share weather data. Weather tools, for example, help us accurately measure the weather conditions of a place. Modern communication technology lets scientists share global weather data quickly and over long distances. These data can then be used to make computer models to predict weather events.
Meteorolgists work hard at predicting the strength and path of storms. In the past, meteorologists had to rely on weather ships and weather-monitoring stations on tropical islands to track hurricanes—the largest, most powerful storms on Earth.
The data from these sources were limited. As a result, predicting the strength and path of these storms was very difficult.
In August 2004, Hurricane Charley moved across the Atlantic Ocean and along the eastern coast of the United States. Data collected by satellites and airplanes helped meteorologists make forecasts to warn people about this storm.
Starting in the 1960s, the United States launched the first of many weather-satellite systems. For the first time, scientists were able to monitor and collect data from the uninhabited parts of Earth. As a result the accuracy of weather forecasts and hurricane tracking improved. Today, satellites along with land- and sea-based weather tools provide information to warn people about the changing weather.
Tropical Depression




A hurricane begins as a thunderstorm near the western coast of Africa. As its winds strengthen, the storm becomes a tropical depression. When winds reach 63 km/h (39 mph), it becomes a tropical storm.
A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when there are winds of 119 km/h (74 mph) or more.

Beaufort Wind Scale
If you were a sailor on a ship, being able to measure wind speed would be very important. In the past, wind speed was estimated by observating its effect on things. Today, we use tools to measure wind speed. Read on to find out about ways to measure wind speed.
In 1805, Sir Francis Beaufort developed a scale to classify wind speed. This scale assigned levels based on sailors' observations.
For example, a Force 3 wind describes a gentle breeze in which ships move steadily across the water. Force 6 describes a strong breeze that produces large waves, whitecaps, and spray. And Force 11 describes a violent storm.
You can observe a flag to see how wind blows. A windsock shows the relative direction and speed of winds. The windsock droops during low wind speed. It flies straight out from the pole during high wind
Use the text and information from reference materials to complete the Beaufort Wind Scale table.

Beaufort Wind Force	Average Wind Speed (km/h)	Description	Beaufort Wind Force	Average Wind Speed (km/h)	Description
0	0	Calm		56	Near Gale
	3	Light Air			Ga|e
	9	Light Breeze		82	Severe Gale
		Gentle Breeze			Storm
	24	Moderate Breeze		110	
		Fresh Breeze	12	124	Hurricane

Today, wind speed is measured using anemometers.
This anemometer uses cuplike devices to measure wind speed. The faster the wind blows, the faster the cups spin. The cups are attached to sensors that measure the actual wind speed.
*
This digital anemometer uses spinning fans to generate magnetic pulses. Then, the instrument
translates these pulses into measurements of the wind speed.
time it takes for sound to travel from each speaker to its microphone. The anemometer uses the data collected to determine wind speed as well as wind direction.
Use observations to design your own scale to measure something such as temperature, cloud cover, or amount or strength of rainfall. Write the process for using the scale, and then try it out.

eople once thought that the sun moved around Earth. After all, the sun seems to rise, to move across the sky, and to set each day. Today we know what makes it seem like the sun moves around Earth. Earth rotates, or turns like a top. Earth rotates
around an imaginary line, called an axis.
Earth’s axis runs through it from the North Pole to the South Pole. Once every 24 hours, or once a day, Earth rotates about its axis.
Earth's rotation causes day and night.
As it rotates, one side of Earth faces the sun. This part of Earth has daytime. The other side of Earth faces away from the sun and has nighttime. As Earth's rotation continues, parts of Earth cycle between day and night.
Each planet rotates at a different rate, so the length of a day is different. For example, Venus rotates so slowly that one day on Venus is equal to 225 days on Earth!

Earth is not alone in space. You can easily spot two other bodies in the sky—the sun and the moon. How do they all move together?
Active Reading As you read these pages, underline the main idea, and circle a sentence that supports it.
nrhe sun. Earth, and the moon form a system in I space. This system is held together by gravity. Gravity is a force that pulls objects toward each other. Gravity pulls Earth toward the sun, holding Earth in orbit around it. An orbit is the path that an object takes around another object in space. Earth revolves, or travels around the sun. It takes Earth about 365 days to complete one revolution.
While Earth revolves around the sun, the moon revolves around Earth. Earth’s gravity pulls on the moon. Like Earth, the moon also turns on its axis. It takes about a month for the moon to complete one rotation. During the same period of time, the moon makes one complete revolution around Earth. As a result, the same side of the moon always faces Earth.

Sun
The sun is so large that about 1 million Earths ■ could fit inside it. The sun’s gravity holds the Earth-moon system in place.
The sun, the moon, and Earth all have distinct characteristics. The sun has the largest diameter of all bodies in the solar system. An object's diameter is the distance from one side, through its center, to the other side.
	Makeup	Diameter	Age
Sun	hot, glowing gases； mostly helium and hydrogen	1,391,000 km (864,400 mi)	about 4.6 billion years old
Earth	rocky surface with large oceans； thick atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen； life forms	12,756 km (7,926 mi)	about 4.5 billion years old
Moon	rocky surface； no atmosphere or water-extreme cold and heat； no known life forms	3,475 km (2,159 mi)	at least 4.5 billion years old
Moon
Earth



Earth spins quickly—more than 1,600 km/hr (1,000 mi/ hr) at its equator As Earth spins, it also speeds around the sun at more than 107,000 km/hr (67,000 mi/hr). Earth and the moon are relatively close to one another They are about 382,000 km (237,400 mi) apart. In contrast, Earth is about 150 million km (93 million mi) from the sun.

How Do They Move?

When it is summer in the United States, it is winter in Chile. How can two places have a different season at the same time of year?
Active Reading As you read this page, underline the cause of
the seasons.
arth rotates on its tilted axis. As Earth revolves around the sun, the direction of its tilted axis doesn't change. The tilt of Earth’s axis and its orbit cause the seasons.
Earth is divided into halves called hemispheres.The Northern Hemisphere extends from the equator to the North Pole. The Southern Hemisphere extends from the equator to the South Pole. In June, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun and gets more direct rays of sunlight. It has more hours of daylight and warmer weather It is summer there.
In June, in the Southern Hemisphere, the opposite season takes place. Why? The Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun and gets less direct sunlight. It has fewer hours of daylight and cooler weather. It is winter there.
In December, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun. As a result, it is winter there. At the same time, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun and has summer.

The Big Dipper is a part of a star pattern in the night sky. To Ancient Greeks, the pattern looked like a giant bear.
Active Reading As you read these pages, draw a circle around words or phrases that provide details about constellations.
people have looked at the stars for thousands of years. A star ■ pattern, or constellation, is a group of stars that seems to form a picture in the night sky. The early Greeks named constellations after animals or people from stories called myths. The Big Dipper is part of a constellation called Ursa Major, or Great Bear Orion is a constellation named after a hunter in a Greek myth.
As Earth rotates on its axis, constellations seem to move across the night sky. Like the sun, constellations seem to rise in the east and set in the west. Stars above the North Pole, however, seem to move in a circle.
The positions of the constellations seem to change with the seasons, because we see different parts of space as Earth revolves around the sun. The stars in the constellations do change a little over time. However, it might take millions of years for a constellation to change its shape!

At one time, people thought Earth was the center of the universe. How did we learn that this isn't true?
I ong ago, astronomers believed Earth was the center Lof the universe. Daily observations seemed to confirm this belief When people looked at the sky, they saw the sun, the moon, planets, and stars in motion. Naturally, they concluded that Earth was at the center of the universe. It took hundreds of years, new technology, and new observations for this idea to change.
In the 1500s, a Polish astronomer named Nicolaus Copernicus designed a new model, or system, of the universe. Based on new observations about the motion of the planets, he suggested that Earth and the planets revolved around the sun. Then, in the 1600s, scientists gathered more evidence to support this sun-centered model of the solar system.
Using a telescope he made, Galileo Galilei was the first to see moons orbiting Jupiter. His observation showed that all objects in space did not orbit Earth. Around this time, Johannes Kepler correctly described the shape of the planets’ orbits around the sun. His calculations showed that the planets revolved around the sun in elliptical [ee-up-tih>kuhl] orbits. All these scientists' observations changed our idea about Earth's place in space.
When people measured time using
sundials, the changing shadow
cast by the sun seemed to confirm
that the sun revolved around
Earth. We now know that the sun
doesn't revolve around Earth.

Scce4itc^t^
Milutin Milankovitch
During an ice age, ice sheets cover much of Earth. Why do ice ages happen? Serbian scientist Milutin Milankovitch [mih.LOO.tin mih#LAHNG#koh#vich] spent his career trying to find out. Milankovitch learned that Earth's orbit changes in cycles lasting thousands of years. He determined that these changes affect the amount of sunlight reaching Earth. As a result, during cooler periods, ice ages occur. Today, data from the ocean floor supports Milankovitch's ideas. These climate patterns are called Milankovitch cycles in his honor.
The direction of Earth's axis changes over time as part of a cycle that lasts about 23,000 years. This change affects Earth's temperature.
■ Maureen Raymo
Dr. Maureen Raymo is an earth scientist. She studies how
Earth's climate has changed over long periods of time. Like
Milankovitch, Dr. Raymo studies the relationship between
changes in Earth's orbit and climate. During an ice age.
much of Earth's water is stored in glaciers. This affects sea
level. Dr. Raymo has been able to find evidence of ancient
changes in climate by studying rocks and sediment on
the ocean floor. Through her research, she has
been able to describe the sea level and water flow

The moon is Earth's satellite, A satellite is an object that moves around another larger object in space. Earth's moon is the largest and brightest object in the night sky. It looks large because it is close to Earth. But the moon is small compared to Earth. It is only about one-fourth the size of Earth. The moon has no air, wind, or liquid water. We see the moon because light from the sun reflects from it and back to Earth.
The pull of Earth's gravity keeps the moon in its orbit around Earth. We see only one side of the moon from Earth. That is because the moon takes the same amount of time to rotate once as it does to orbit Earth once.

Moon Pha<?e<?
One night, you might look at the moon and see a tiny sliver in the sky. A few nights later, you might see a bright, round circle. What makes the moon look so different?
As you read the last paragraph, write numbers
next to the sentences to show the sequence of moon phases.
New Moon
▲
As Earth orbits the sun, the moon also orbits Earth. The moon reflects light from the sun. That is the light we see from Earth. As the moon travels in its orbit, different amounts of the moon’s lit side can be seen from Earth.
During the new moon phase, the moon is between Earth and the sun.

We can’t see the moon at all. During a first quarter moon, we see one-half of the moon's lit side.

The moon’s shape does not change. The changes in the appearance of the moon's shape are known as moon phases.
You know that sunlight reflects from the moon to Earth. Yet the sun lights only half of the moon at any time. The motions of Earth and the moon are responsible for the phases you see. As the moon revolves around Earth, the amount of the lit part that we see from Earth changes. These different amounts of the moon's lighted side are the different phases of the moon.
Each phase of the moon has a different shape. It takes about 1 month for the moon to complete all of its phases. Then the cycle repeats.
During the new moon phase, we can’t see the moon. That is because the lit part of the moon faces away from Earth. As the moon moves in its orbit around Earth, we see more of the moon's lit part We see a full moon when all of the lit part of the moon faces Earth. Then we see less and less of the lit part again.
Do the Math!
Estimate Fractions and Percentages
What fraction and percent of the moon's lit side is seen during each phase? Complete the table.
	Full moon	First quarter	New moon	Third quarter
Fraction		2		
Percent		50%		
Full Moon
Third Quarter
The lit portion grows larger until we see a full moon. This happens when Earth is between the moon and the sun. As the moon continues in its orbit, we see less of its lit portion. When it is half lit again, it is a third quarter moon.

Lunar and cTolar
Calendars
For thousands of years, people used the phases of the moon to make calendars and track time. These are called lunar calendars. Earth’s orbit around the sun also has been used to make calendars and track time. These are called solar calendars.	»
The Chinese Zodiac Calendar
The Chinese zodiac calendar is based in part on the phases of the moon. Twelve animals stand for cycles of time on the calendar. Some of these animals are the tiger, rabbit, dragon, and snake. Each year is also given an animal name, for example, in 2026, it will be the uYear of the Horse/'The year 2027 will be the ''Year of the Sheeps
The Aztec calendar is based on Earth’s
orbit around the sun. Each part of the calendar has colorful animals or symbols. These symbols marked important times of the year, such as when to plant crops.
New Year's Day
In the United States, New Year's Day is always January 1. In China, it is on the day of the new moon. Why do you think New Year’s Day always falls on a different day each year in China?
Our modern calendar is based on Earth's orbit around the sun. Each month is based roughly on the moon's phases. Once in a while, there are two full moons in one month.

The
Right Spot
Living things like those found on Earth do not
exist elsewhere in the solar system, which makes Earth a unique place.
1
Venus and Earth are sometimes called sister planets, but Earth supports life and Venus does not. It's all because of Earth's position within the solar system's life zone.
ut of the eight planets in our solar system, only Earth has life as we know it. Why? Scientists think it is because Earth is the only planet within the solar system's life zone. The life zone is the region of space where the temperature range allows life to thrive.
Our solar system's life zone begins just outside Venus's orbit and ends before the orbit of Mars.
If Earth were outside this zone, it would be either too hot or too cold for life to exist on our planet. Earth sits near the center of the life zone.
Our moon is also within the life zone, yet it has no life. Why? The moon doesn't have an atmosphere or liquid water. Earth's atmosphere does many things to support life. It traps solar energy to keep Earth's temperature comfortable. It contains the gases that most living things need. It also protects living things from harmful solar radiation.
Earth's average temperature is about 13 °C (55 °F). Earth's oceans help maintain this temperature. The oceans store and distribute heat from the sun. Ocean currents carry heat away from the equator and toward the poles. Without the oceans to store and distribute heat from the sun, some places on Earth would be extremely cold or extremely hot.

Typically, engineering design problems have many solutions. An engineer often needs to find a balance among many trade-offs < to get the best solution. A trade-off \s the giving up of one design feature to make another design feature better The charts below show trade-off analyses for spacecraft with and without crew. The benefits and drawbacks of some major design features of each kind of mission are shown. You decide which one should blast off
Spacecraft with Crew
Design Feature	Benefit	Drawback
living space for crew	people onboard to fix problems and run difficult science experiments	greater cost to build and to fuel； increased weight during liftoff (must store air, food, and water}
heat shield for reentry to Earth’s atmosphere	safe return of crew； reusable ship	more fuel needed； less space for everything else
Spacecraft without Crew
Design Feature	Benefit	Drawback
smaller, lighter	less fuel needed-costs less to launch	less room for instruments
no living space for crew	no need to store air, food, water	no one to fix problems or watch experiments
large energy suppy to last many years in space	can learn about faraway objects	spacecraft doesn't return to Earth； it cannot be reused

Analyze Trade-offs
Engineers think about trade-offs before designing a spacecraft. Sometimes, the trade-offs lead them to conclude that a particular solution is not worth trying.


Suppose a crew wants new space suits. Use the features and trade-offs of the old and new space suits to answer the questions below.
Old Space Suit		New Space Suit	
Design Feature		Design Feature	Trade 庸 off
thick space suit protects astronaut against extreme temperatures and debris	hard to move around in	thinner space suit lighter and easier to move around in	may not protect as well as the old suit against extreme temperatures or debris
sturdy material and strong joints	difficult to put on quickly	has newer technologies built in	all technologies may not have been tested in space!
What is the most important feature of a space suit?
Do you think the benefits of the new space suit outweigh its trade-offs? Why or why not?

underline the sentence that gives the main
idea about density.
ensity is a physical property of
matter. It tells how much space
(volume) a certain amount (mass) of matter
takes up. In other words, density is the
amount of matter present in a certain
volume of a substance.
Density indicates how close together the
particles in an object are. The density of a
substance is always the same, no matter
how much of the substance there is. A small
piece of an eraser, for example, has the
same density as a whole eraser.

Matter exists in different forms. The air around us is a gas. The water we drink is a liquid. Your book is a solid.
Active Reading As you read these two pages, underline the
contrasting characteristics of each state of matter.

• _ —__
Solids, liquids, and gases are three states of matter. Most matter on Earth is classified as one of these forms.
A solid has a definite volume and shape. Your desk, book, pencil, and chair are all solids. Solids stay solid unless something, such as heat changes them.
A liquid has a definite volume but not
—gas
a definite shape. A liquid takes the shape of whatever container holds it. Water, shampoo, and fruit juice are liquids.
A gas doesn't have a definite volume or shape. It expands to take up all the space in a container. If you blow up a balloon, you can see that air spreads out to fill the space. The air we breathe is a mixture of gases.
► Label each item as a solid, a liquid, or a gas.

You are nearly 70% water! The rest of your body is made ofgases such as oxygen and solids such as fats.
Water can be a solid, a liquid, or a gas. This ice cube is solid water. It melts into a liquid. When water is a gas, it is called water vapor
w
ater is made of tiny particles. We can learn what state water is in by knowing how fast
the particles in it move
Solid
The particles in solids vibrate in place. The particles in the solid form of most substances are closer than those in the liquid form. Water is an exception—the water particles in ice are farther apart than in liquid water.
Liquid

Evaporation
When heat energy is added to water, its particles speed up. Particles that gain enough energy enter the air as water vapor. Evaporation is the process by which a liquid changes into a gas. Water evaporates from oceans, lakes, and rivers every day.
Condensation
When heat energy is removed from a gas, its particles slow down and clump together. Condensation is the process by which a gas changes into a liquid. Clouds form when water vapor condenses on particles of dust in the air.

Here’s Why Th e Statue of Liberty is made of copper.
Copper is a metal that can be hammered into different shapes. This change is a physical change. At first, the statue was the color of the copper crystal. Over time, its exposed surface reacted with substances in the air and changed color. This change is a chemical change. The substance that covers the surface of the Statue of Liberty today is different from the original copper.

Matter can be changed in many ways. In how many ways can you change a piece of paper?
paper is soggy, but it hasn’t become a new substance.
Shredded
Does shredding the paper make a new substance? No, it just changes the shape of the paper into tiny pieces.
392
Think of a piece of clay_ Can it be I changed like paper can? If you pull bits from the clay, you change its size. If you flatten the clay, you change its shape. The size or shape may be different, but it is still clay. Changing size and shape is a physical change. A physical change is a change in which a new substance is not formed.
You can scratch a piece of clay until it is rough. It has a new texture, but it is still clay. You can add bits to it- It is heavier, but adding clay does not make a new substance. Changing a physical property, such as size, shape, texture, or mass, is a physical change.

You get a juice pop from the freezer. As you
eat the pop, it begins to drip. What causes this physical change to take place in your frozen treat?
Active Rgadinqi As you read this page, underline its main idea
he sticky juice dripping down your arm is caused by a change in state.
A change in state is a physical change that takes place when heat energy is added or removed from matter. When you take a juice pop out of the freezer, the pop begins to warm up. As a result, the solid juice begins to melt.
Melting is a change in state from a solid to a liquid. It takes place when heat energy is added to a solid.
Physical Changes
Making glass and candles are examples of physical changes. To make a glass pitcher, solid glass is heated. The glass melts and becomes a thick liquid. Then, the melted glass is molded or blown into shape. When the glass cools, it hardens into a solid.
Evaporation is a change in state from a liquid to a gas. It takes place when heat energy is added to a liquid. When the water in a melted juice pop evaporates, sugar, syrup, and food coloring are left behind.
You can make your own pops by freezing liquid juice. Freezing is a change in state from a liquid to a solid. It takes place when heat energy is removed from

and is a tan-colored solid. Water is a liquid. If you put sand and water into a bucket, they form a mixture because their properties do not change. A mixture is a combination of two or more substances that keep their identities. The sand is still a tan solid, and the water is still a liquid. Neither has become a different substance.
A salad is also a mixture. When you mix lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, and other vegetables, no new substances are made.
For this reason, making a mixture is a physical change.

Some metals are a type of mixture called a solution. A solution is a mixture in which the substances are evenly mixed. To make some rings, gold and another metal, such as copper, are melted together. When the liquid metals are evenly mixed, they are poured into a mold where they cool and harden to form a solid ring.
Seawater is a solution of solids that are dissolved in a liquid. Most of the solid parts of seawater are salts. Its liquid part, water, is a solvent. A solvent is the larger part of a solution that dissolves other substances. A solute is a substance that dissolves in a solvent. Solutes are the smaller part of a solution. The dissolved salts in seawater are solutes.

Clean Up an
Oily Mess
Water is a solvent in many solutions.
In fact, water is called the universal solvent. Water can dissolve more things
than any other known solvent.
Soaps, such as the types used to wash our bodies and dishwashing and laundry detergents, have ingredients that help water break up oil and
iven enough time, rocks will dissolve in water However, something that will not dissolve in water is oil. When you mix oil and water, the oil forms drops or layers that float on the water.
Oil can be messy when it gets on things. Water alone can’t clean up an oily mess. People need to
mix water with detergent.

O)
398
O)
Detergent particles form bonds with water particles and reduce their ability to bond to each other. Detergent particles also like to form bonds with oil particles. Detergent and water work together to break up oil into smaller particles that can be washed away.
Detergents can be used to clean up the environment In 2010, an oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico spilling millions of gallons of oil. The oil affected many marine plants and animals including water birds. The oil stuck to the birds' feathers, making it hard for them to swim, % and keep warm. To clean up the birds, wildlife scientists and volunteers used dishwashing detergent.

Detergent bonds with oil particles on the bird’s feathers and helps water wash the particles away.

Answer Key： 1. A mixture is a combination of two or more substances that keep their identities. 2.-4. (in any order) A solution is a mixture with evenly mixed substances.； Because the substances in a mixture retain their identities, making a mixture is a physical change.； In a solution, a solute is the smaller part and is the substance dissolved.

Copper tarnishes if left exposed; however, aluminum does not Why? Copper and aluminum have different chemical properties.
A chemical property is a property that describes how a substance interacts with other substances.
Substances can be identified and grouped based on their chemical properties. The ability to rust is a chemical property of iron； aluminum is a substance that does not rust. The ability to burn is a chemical property of wood and gasoline. Resistance to burning is a chemical property of gold and water.
Chemical properties can help us predict how substances will change in different conditions. Think again about making a pizza. You mix flour, water, yeast, and other ingredients. When heated, these ingredients interact to form a tasty pizza. The dough will not form a pizza if you put it in a refrigerator. In the same way, wood burning in a fireplace gives off heat, light, and gases and leaves behind a pile of ash. Unless it is burned, the wood will not change into these new substances.

The following clues tell us that a chemical change has taken place：
_ Odor Bacteria cause the bad smell of sour milk as they form new substances.
_ Color change Sunlight shines on billboards, causing the colors to chemically change and fade.
_ Light Light from a campfire or a firefly shows that chemical changes have taken place.
_ Heat Burning is a chemical reaction.
When materials burn, they give off heat
_ Gas bubbles Adding baking soda to vinegar causes gas bubbles to form.
Chemical Change
You don’t want to eat this orange! The mold causes a chemical change, forming new substances that are not safe to eat!
Physical Change
You can take a bite of this orange! It is broken into segments, but it is still the same sweet, juicy orange. This physical change did not form a new substance.

Another name for a chemical change is a chemical reaction. Chemical reactions can take place slowly or quickly. People can control the rate of some chemical reactions. For example, you can slow the spoiling of milk by keeping it cold. On the other hand, an increase in temperature often speeds up a chemical reaction. Cutting something into smaller pieces can also speed up a reaction. If you have ever helped an adult start a campfire, you know that it is easier to get small twigs to burn than to try to set fire to a log!
Certain substances can cause some chemical reactions to speed up. For example, your stomach adds substances that help speed the breakdown of the food you eat

Pizza comes in many varieties: thin-crust, thick-crust, pepperoni, and veggie. Can you keep track of all the physical and chemical changes that go into making one of these pizzas?
1 Start with the Dough
Mix flour and water until the mixture is gooey. Next, add some yeast and a little sugar. The yeast breaks down the sugar to form new substances, including carbon dioxide gas. The gas makes bubbles in the dough, causing it to rise. The bubbles tell you that there is a chemical change. The dough is now ready to push, pull, and shape into a crust—these are physical changes.
Z Add the Toppings
Make the sauce by crushing tomatoes and mixing in spices. Because you can separate the spices from the tomatoes, this is a physical change. Spread the sauce, and shred some cheese on top of it. The cheese is still cheese, so this is another physical change. You can cut up some of your favorite vegetables to put on top.
No new substances are formed, because cutting is a physical change.

Now it is time to bake the pizza. The dough gets hot and turns brown. It changes from dough into a crust that is nice and crispy. You can smell the dough baking and see the change in color and texture, so you know chemical changes are happening.
)Dig In!
Slice the pizza. Slicing is a physical change. Then take a big bite. As you eat the pizza, it reacts with the juices in your stomach. Your body uses it for energy. Chemical changes are taking place.

Body Armor
Do you skate? Play football? Or play catcher for a softball team? If so, then you know how hard, bulky, and heavy sports safety gear can be. Not to worry —change is coming. Members of the U.S. Olympic ski team have worn suits with safety pads made of a new kind of body armor!

These light-weight, flexible, shock-absorbing safety pads mold to the wearer s body. Long chains of carbon and hydrogen particles make up the pads.

Before an impact, these particles are loosely connected, which gives the armor its gel-like flexibility.

On impact, the particles quickly absorb the energy produced. They ''lock” together, and the pad hardens to protect the wearer Then Just as quickly as before, the particles unlock, and the pad returns to its gel-like state!
Over time, sunlight can make the new safety pads hard and breakable. Suppose safety gear made from this material will be worn in full sun. How would you change its design?

Ruth Rogan Benerito

Ruth Rogan Benerito's work as a chemist
gave us wash-and-wear cotton clothing

Before the 1950s, clothing made from
cotton wrinkled after washing. So# many
people switched to synthetic cloth. The
cotton farmers began to suffer. Benerito
discovered a way to treat the cotton
particles so that they were chemically
joined In doing so, she made a cloth that
had few wrinkles. Benerito taught college
classes for many years.
Dr. Abruna studies
ethanol as a
possible fuel source
for fuel cells.

mi
Ethanol is a made
from corn or other
plants.

Benerito invented
wash-and-wear
cotton. It doesn’t
need ironing.








Factor iUmi 的

Dr Hector Abruna is a chemist. He studies
fuel cells. A fuel cell makes electricity
from chemical changes. Unlike energy
from burning fossil fuels, there is very
little pollution from a fuel cell. Fuel cells
can provide energy for cars, buildings.
and even cell phones. Abruna has taught
chemistry at Cornell University for nearly
30 years. He works to help more women
and minorities become scientists.

Something in motion, such as the girl on the pogo stick, has kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. Something at the top of a hill, such as a roller coaster car, has potential energy. Potential energy is the energy something has because of its position or condition.
Mechanical energy is the total potential energy and kinetic energy of an object.
The girl pushes the pogo stick's spring down. The spring now has potential energy. When the spring spreads out, the pogo stick goes up and has kinetic energy.
As the roller coaster cars climb to the top of a hill, they gain potential energy. The higher the cars go, the more potential energy they have.
As the cars go down a hill, their potential energy decreases because it changes to kinetic energy. The roller coaster cars have more kinetic energy when they move faster At each point along the ride, the mechanical energy of the cars is the sum of their potential and kinetic energies.
This roller coaster goes fast because of mechanical energy. That’s good, because a slow roller coaster isn’t much fun!

Active	As	you	read	these	two
pages, find and underline the definition of heat
Temperature measures how hot or cold something is. Energy moves between objects that have different temperatures. YouVe already learned about many kinds of energy. Heat is the energy that moves between objects of different temperatures. The difference in temperature makes the energy move.
You sense heat as a warming feeling. More precisely, you feel the change in temperature as you gain energy. Heat moves naturally from an object with a high temperature to one with a lower temperature. In other words, heat moves from a warmer object to a cooler object-

Conduction
Conduction is the transfer, or movement, of heat between two objects that are touching. It can also occur within an object. Heat moves from inside your body to warm your skin. Your feet and hands stay warm because heat moves all around your body.
Heat is conducted from the soup to the spoon. Soon the spoon feels hot to the touch.

Heated water travels up, warming the cooler water above.
Cooler water sinks to the bottom, where it gets heated. The cycle repeats. This movement is called a convection current

Convection
Convection is the transfer of heat within a liquid or a gas. Particles in liquids and gases move easily, and they take heat with them. Heat from a campfire warms the air around it by convection. Warmer air is always buoyed upward. In this case, the fire is the source of heat for convection.
Hot air rises above cooler air. That’s what keeps a hot-air balloon in flight.

Qo with the flow...
A pan in the oven gets very hot. But if you pick it up with an oven mitt, your hand stays cool. Why?
A<tivc Reading As you read these two pages, circle lesson vocabulary each time it is used.
Heat moves through some materials very easily. In the example above, heat from the oven moved easily into the pan. But heat from the pan did not pass through the oven mitt. A material that allows heat to move through it easily is called a conductor Many heat conductors also conduct electricity well.
For the most part, solids are better conductors of heat than liquids or gases are. That's because the particles that make up a solid are packed closely together They vibrate, but don't move apart much. Heat can move quickly from one particle to another.
Glass
Glass does not conduct heat well. If you pour boiling water into a metal bowl, the outside of the bowl quickly gets hot. A glass bowl gets warm more slowly.
Stone
Marble does not conduct heat as well as metals do. But it can still conduct heat away from your body. That's why marble feels cool when you touch it.
Metal
Metals are great heat conductors. Some metals conduct heat better than others do.

Getting Hot
This diagram shows the particles of a metal ban The particles on this end are hot. This end was placed over a flame, but the other end wasn't.
Still Cool
The particles on this end aren't hot yet, but they will be soon. In metals, heat moves from particle to particle very easily.

Around
Wearing gloves insulates your hands The gloves trap heat near your skin.
Not all materials
are
conductors. Heat does not
move easily——or at all
through some materials.
Active Reading As you read these pages,
find and underline two effects of insulators.
aterials that do not conduct heat well are called insulators. Oven mitts are insulators. They are made of materials that are poor conductors of heat. When you remove a pan of cookies from the oven, your hands don’t get burned
Gases can be good insulators. A thin layer of trapped air is an excellent insulator. In
cold weather, layers of clothing trap your
body heat near you. There's air between the layers of clothing. Along with the clothing, the air insulates your body.
Insulators can be used to slow down the movement of heat. Metal wires conduct electricity and heat. Most wires are covered in rubber to insulate them and keep people safe from the electricity and heat.
,，j
Hair as an Insulator
Most furry animals stay warm in cold weather. Fur is made of thick hairs Around each hair is air. The air and the fur act as insulators, keeping the animal warm.

Glass lining
A layer of glass holds the tea. Glass does not conduct heat very well.
Reflection
Even in a vacuum, radiation can move energy. The facing sides of the layers are coated in silver, which act like a mirror. It reflects some heat back.
Vacuum
There is a vacuum between the inner and outer glass layers of the bottle. The vacuum keeps conduction or convection from taking place.
Still Hot
With the conduction, convection, and radiation slowed down, the tea stays hot for a long time!
^ Although the straw house is not the sturdiest, a straw house can be well insulated. Why?

Proofing
a Home
All across the United States, people are trying to conserve, or save, energy. It’s good for the environment, and it saves money. Heat proofing a home is one way that people can conserve energy.
When the weather is hot, you want to
keep heat from coming into your home. When the weather is cold, you want to keep heat from leaving your home. It costs money to cool and heat a home!
There are different ways to slow the flow of
heat into or out of a house. Some things need to be done while the house is being built. Others can be done to an existing home. Insulating a home saves money. It also helps conserve energy.
468
Insulation
Insulation is blown inside the walls of a house. Insulation keeps heat from traveling through to the attic.
Windows
These windows have two panes of glass to limit conduction. They also have a coating that limits heat radiation.
Pipes
Hot pipes radiate heat from water into the air. Wrapping them keeps the heat from escaping.
今 Soil
Soil is a great insulator Basements are usually cool, even in the summer.
Qo the Math!
Solve Real-World Problems
The Ogburn family wants to heat proof their house. They can save about $800 a year by adding insulation. Wrapping the water pipes will save an additional $5 each month. Buying new, energy-efficient windows will save them about $2,000 every year.
1. How much money will wrapping the water pipes save the Ogburns in a year?
2. About how much more money will replacing the windows save each year than wrapping the water pipes?
3.	Write an equation to calculate how much all three things will save the
Ogburns in a year.
Bonus!
If new windows cost $10,500, pipe insulation costs $100f and adding insulation costs $400, in how many years will the savings pay for the cost of these home improvements?

hat do you, this book, and your desk all have in common? You are all made of atoms. Atoms are the building blocks of all matter.
Atoms are so small that you cannot even see them without a special microscope. Atoms are made up of even smaller particles called protons, neutrons, and electrons.
The main difference between protons, electrons, and neutrons is their electric charge. Electric charge is a property of a particle that affects how it behaves around other particles.
_ Protons have a positive charge (+1).
_ Electrons have a negative charge (-1).
■ Neutrons are neutral. They have no charge.
When an atom has equal numbers of protons and electrons, the positive charges and negative charges cancel each other. The atom itself has no charge.
Protons and neutrons are found in a region of the atom called the nucleus. Electrons are found in a region of mostly empty space called the electron cloud.

Each of these atoms has the same number of protons and electrons. Both atoms are neutral.
An electron from the atom on the left moves to the atom on the right.
The atom on the left now has a charge of +1. The atom on the right has a charge of-1.
Atoms sometimes gain or lose electrons. This gain or loss causes an atom to have an unequal number of positive and negative charges. For example, if an atom with nine protons and nine electrons gains an electron, the atom will have a charge of -1.
If a neutral atom loses an electron, the number of protons will no longer balance the number of electrons. The atom will have a charge of +1 f

When you brush your hair, electrons move from each strand of hair to the brush. Soon, all the strands are positively charged. All the strands having the same charge causes them to repel one another and stick out.
A charged object can attract a neutral object If you rub a balloon on your hair, the balloon picks up extra electrons that give it a negative charge. When you bring the balloon near a wall, electrons in a small part of the wall are repelled and move away, leaving a positive charge at the wall surface. As a result the balloon sticks to the wall.

Thunderstorms can be scary. Lightning can be dangerous. What is lightning? How can you stay safe during a thunderstorm?
underline the main idea on each page.
Static electricity is a buildup of charges on an object. Charges stay on an object until it comes close to an object that has a different charge.
As you walk across a carpet, electrons move from the carpet to you. Because electrons repel each other, they spread out all over your body. When you touch something, the electrons jump from your finger to the object. This jumping is called an electrostatic discharge. You feel it as a tiny shock-
► Complete this cause-and-effect graphic organizer.
Zap! Electrons jump from a person with a negative charge.
Cause： An object with a negative charge is placed near an object with a positive charge
Effect
Not all electrostatic discharges cause small shocks. Some result in huge shocks. During a thunderstorm, tiny raindrops or ice particles bump into each other. These collisions cause an electric charge to build in the clouds. Positive charges form at the top of a cloud and on the ground. Negative charges form near the bottom of a cloud.
When the difference in charge between a cloud and the ground is great enough, there is a huge electrostatic discharge that we call lightning. A lightning spark can jump between two clouds, between a cloud and the air, or between a cloud and the ground. The temperature inside a lightning bolt can reach 27,760 °C (50,000 °F), which is hotter than the surface of the sun!

Wires connect all of these homes to an energy station.
You can use an electric current to do many kinds of useful work. We use electric currents for cooking food, lighting a room, and producing sound.
A battery is a source of electric current. Chemical reactions in a battery provide the
energy that causes the electrons to flow.
Most of the electric current used in schools,
homes, and businesses does not come from
batteries. Instead, it comes from an electricity
generating station, or energy station.
There are many types of energy stations. Energy stations change different types of energy, such as chemical, nuclear, or mechanical energy, into electrical energy. Wires carry the electrical energy from the generating station to every outlet in your home. These wires may be on poles above ground or buried below ground.

r
Never climb or play near wires, and never dig in the ground where there are wires.

Shocking!
Working around electric utility lines is dangerous! How does a line worker stay safe?
Active	Draw	a	box	around the sentences that contrast
conductors and insulators.
ven on a hot day, a worker who repairs electric utility lines must be L bundled up in protective clothing. The thick gloves, the bulky boots, and the hard plastic hat are heavy； however, these clothes protect the worker from an electric shock!
The rubber and plastic used in the protective clothing do not allow electric charges to flow through them. A material that resists the flow of electric charges is called an insulator. Electric charges flow easily through metals and some liquids. A material that readily allows electric charges to pass through it is called a conductor.
This worker’s clothing is made up of insulators. The clothing will not allow electric charges to flow through it if the worker accidentally touches the wrong wires.
The parts of a plug that

If the wiring in a lamp does not change, why isn?t the lamp on all of the time?
Active Reading Draw a box around the sentences that tell you how a closed circuit and an open circuit are different.
When you go to school and back home,
your path is a loop. A circuit is a path along which electric charges can flow. For an electrical device to work, the circuit must form a complete loop. This type of circuit is called a closed circuit There are no breaks in its path.
What happens if a loose wire gets disconnected? The path is broken, and charges cannot flow. This type of circuit is called an open circuit. Many circuits have a switch. A switch controls the flow of charges by opening and closing the circuit.
What's Wrong?
The buzzer in this circuit is not working. Trace the circuit with your finger, and describe what's wrong with the circuit.
Open Circuit
When the switch in a circuit is open, the circuit is not complete. Electric charges cannot flow, so the light stays off

Active Redding Underline the sentences that compare series circuits and parallel circuits.
Series Circuits

In a series circuit, electric charges must follow a single path. The charged particles move from the battery's positive terminal to its negative terminal.
Draw arrows to show how charges flow in this circuit.
506
If one light bulb in a series circuit burns out, all of the lights go out, because the circuit is broken.
Suppose that the television and all the lights in a room are part of the same circuit What would happen if one of the light bulbs burned out? It would depend on how the circuit is wired.
A series circuit has only one path for electric charges to follow. If any part of the path breaks, the circuit is open. Nothing works!
A circuit with several different paths for the charges to follow is called a parallel circuit If one part of the circuit breaks, the charges can still flow along the other parts.

and Magnetism
Each flat surface on a ring magnet is either an N pole or an S pole.
You can feel the force between two magnets. You feel magnets pull together, and you feel them push apart. How do magnets work?
Active Readiliqi As you read these two pages, underline words or phrases that describe what causes magnets to push or pull.
agnets have been used for thousands of years.
A magnet is an object that attracts iron and a few other metals. People make magnets, but they are also found in nature. Magnets are found in many common things.
Magnetism is a physical property of matter Magnets
its magnetic field is the strongest. One end is called the south-seeking pole, or S pole. The other is the north-seeking pole, or N pole.
Two N poles or two S poles are similar, or like, poles. If you place the N poles of two magnets near each other, they repel, or push away. Two

The picture above shows a bar magnet. The iron filings around the magnet show the shape of the magnetic field. Where do you see the most iron filings? They are at the S and N poles of the magnet, which are where the magnetic field is strongest. Where do you see fewer iron filings? The middle of the magnet has fewer iron filings. The magnetic field is weakest there. The size and the type of material used to make a magnet affect its strength.

Electricity and magnetism are related. One can produce the other.
Active RMding As you read this page, circle the sentence that explains how magnetism produces an electric current.
Suppose you slide a coil of wire back and forth around a bar magnet When the ends of the wire are attached to a light bulb, the bulb lights! Moving a magnet and a wire near each other produces an electric current.
Turning the handle on the device below turns a coil of wire inside three U-shaped magnets. Electric charges flow through the wire and the bulb lights. On the picture on the right, an electric current is used to make a magnet
522
If magnets produce electricity, can electricity make magnets? Yes! Wrapping a coil of current-carrying wire around an iron coil such as a nail makes a magnet. You can use this magnet to pick up small iron objects such as paper clips. A device in which current produces magnetism is called an electromagnet.
Huge electromagnets are used in junkyards. They separate iron and steel objects from other objects. The operator swings the electromagnet over a pile of junk. He turns on the current All the iron
pieces are attracted to the magnet. The operator then swings the magnet over a container and turns off the current.
The magnetism stops, and the iron drops into the container
Electromagnets have become very important and useful- Today, every electric motor contains at least one electromagnet. You can also find electromagnets in telephones, doorbells, speakers, and computers. Doctors can use electromagnets to take pictures of the inside of the body.

uppose you spin a magnet inside a coil of wire. A current begins to flow through the wire. YouVe made a generator, a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. Huge generators in energy stations produce electricity that travels through wires to homes, schools, and businesses.
Some energy stations use falling water or wind to turn generators. Other stations convert sunlight, or solar energy, into electrical energy. These resources are called renewable resources, because they can be replaced quickly.
Most energy stations burn coal or other fuels to heat water. The water rises as steam, which turns the generators.
Coal is a nonrenewable resource that will eventually run out. That's why it's important for us to conserve, or use less.

words that describe specific reference points
s!qJOo/s>EQE!l® AU03dEOoo)u!-csjlqnQLtrnooJa3H ujlslAJ usIo)noH ◎
You know something is moving if its position changes against a background. The background is called the frame of reference.
The picture of the penguin shows three images taken as the penguin jumped off the ice. Notice that each image of the penguin has the same frame of reference.
You can choose any part of that background as a reference point. The words top of the ice describe the reference point for Image 1.
Both top of the ice and the wafer describe reference points for Image 2. Only the water describes a reference point for Image 3.
What if the images of the penguin had been in the wrong order? Could you put them in the correct order? Sure! You know that things don't fall up, so you could use the water as the reference point for each image. The image of the penguin highest above the water must be first. The image of the penguin closest to the water is last.
Look at the pictures of the horse race. In the pictures, what can you use for reference points? How can you use the reference points to put the pictures in order?

The turtle, cat, and rabbit start running at the same time. How far does each of them go in 10 seconds?
5low
Could a turtle beat a rabbit in a race?
It depends on each animal’s speed.
#
AtfiVCjRmllBq As you read this page, underline the
definitions of speed and velocity.
One way to describe motion is to find speed, or how fast or slow something is moving. Speed tells you how the position of an object changes during a certain amount of time. You can measure time in hours (hr), minutes (min), or seconds (sec)_ To find an object's speed, you divide how far it goes by the time it takes to get there. So if you walk 30 meters (m) in 15 seconds (sec), your speed is 2 m/sec
How is velocity different from speed? Velocity is the speed of an object in a particular direction. Suppose you walk toward the east. If your speed is 2 m/sec, then your velocity is 2 m/sec, east.
In a race on a straight track, all the runners move in the same direction. Their velocities differ only because their speeds differ. Could a turtle win a race against a rabbit? Sure! The rabbit might run at a very slow speed—or in the wrong direction!

w
hat have you pushed or pulled today? Maybe you pushed open a door or pulled on your shoes. A push or a pull is a force. Suppose you want to change the way something is moving. A force can change an object’s speed or direction.
Many forces act on you. Crovity is a force that pulls objects down to Earth. Gravity keeps you on the ground or on a chair.
Friction is a force that acts directly against the direction of motion. Friction can slow things down or make them stop.

Acceleration of any kind is caused by forces. Forces can push and pull on matter from all directions. If a force pushing against an object in one direction is greater than a force pushing in the opposite direction, the object will accelerate.

Gyroscopes are used in airplanes, boats, and spacecraft. Electronic sensors around a gyroscope tell how the vehicle has moved. Think about how data from a gyroscope might help keep a spacecraft from veering off course. In the space below, make a list of the vehicle's systems that may use data from the gyroscope.
On Earth, a magnetic compass tells us which direction we are facing. A space telescope cannot use a magnetic compass. These compasses do not work in space. So, the Hubble Space Telescope uses gyroscopes to maintain direction.
