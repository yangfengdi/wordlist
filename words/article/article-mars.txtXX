NASA has a new rover. This is a robotic vehicle. It is for exploration. The name of the rover is Perseverance. It landed on Mars on February 18, 2021. Mars is a neighboring planet in our solar system.

NASA needed to land the rover safely on Mars. A powerful camera called HiRISE helped. It is on a spacecraft. The spacecraft launched in 2005. It orbits, or travels around, Mars. HiRISE takes detailed photos of Mars.

The camera has sent back 69,000 pictures so far. And it is still sending more.

Finding The Right Spot

Perseverance landed in Jezero Crater. The crater is a lake that dried up. There, scientists hope to find signs of past life on Mars. They used HiRISE to look at different landing sites.

Image 2. An artist's drawing of NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter which carries HiRise around the planet. Image: NASA/JPL
They needed a flat area to land the rover. They wanted to avoid big rocks and sand. That would make it hard for the rover to move. HiRISE took 81 pictures to find the right spot.

The camera still helps the rover. Perseverance is 225 million kilometers (140 million miles) away. NASA needs to see where the rover is. The camera can see the tracks the rover makes. It catches where the rover is going. And it shows where the rover has been.

Monitoring Changes

HiRISE helped Perseverance. But it helps scientists in other ways, too. There is a lot we do not know about Mars. The camera lets scientists study the changing surface.

Scientists once thought the surface of Mars did not change. They thought changes happened billions of years ago. But HiRISE has shown that is not true.

The camera takes images of the same place at different times. Scientists look over the pictures. They look for any changes.

They learned that avalanches happen on Mars. Avalanches happen when rocks and other materials fall down the side of a mountain.

There are dunes on Mars, too. These are big mounds of sand piled up by the wind. The dunes travel, too. The sand moves 1 meter every year on Mars. That is 3 feet every 687 Earth days.

Where To Now

So what is next for HiRISE? The camera has covered only a small part of the surface of Mars. If all goes well, it will work for years to come. And take a lot more pictures!

Later this summer, NASA will send a robotic helicopter to Mars for the first time. The helicopter runs on solar power. The space agency chose to name the helicopter Ingenuity. The word means being clever or original. The name was suggested by Vaneeza Rupani. She is a high school student. She lives in Northport, Alabama.

Rupani's idea was part of NASA's "Name the Rover" essay contest. The contest was open to American K-12 students. Students sent in about 28,000 names.

Ingenuity Is What Lets Us Explore Space, Rupani Said

Ingenuity is what lets us explore space, Rupani said. It allows people to do amazing things. It lets us expand our horizons. Thanks to ingenuity, we can explore the edges of the universe.

The helicopter will go to Mars with a new Rover. The rover is a vehicle that explores Mars from the ground. Its name is Perseverance.  That name was also a student suggestion.

Jim Bridenstine works at NASA. He says Ingenuity is a good name for the helicopter. Alabama Senator Richard Shelby agrees. Shelby congratulated Rupani on her win.

Rupani says she was glad to be part of this process.

Testing The Helicopter On Mars

NASA has already tested Ingenuity on Earth. Next, it will be attached to the Perseverance. The rover will be sent to Mars in July or August. After it gets to Mars, the helicopter will stay under a covering. This will keep it safe. When the time is right, scientists will launch the helicopter. They will test how well it can fly on Mars. NASA planned the tests to run for about a month.

This year's mission is part of a bigger program. NASA is planning its next moon landing for 2024. This will put the first woman and the next man on the moon. By 2028, the space agency wants to have humans on or near the moon continuously. They will use the moon as a base. From there, it will be easier to send astronauts other places. They could even send them to Mars.

NASA has a new rover named Perseverance. It landed on Mars on February 18, 2021. Mars is a neighboring planet in our solar system. It took seven months to reach Mars from Earth.

A rover is a robotic vehicle used for exploration. Perseverance has a mission. It is looking for signs of life on Mars. It will collect rocks and soil. Scientists will study them. It will help them better understand Mars. The mission will also test some new technology.

High-Tech Data Collector

Perseverance is the size of a car. It has six wheels. The rover moves on its own. It uses two computers to move. One computer figures out where the rover needs to go. The other computer "sees" its surroundings.

The rover has high-tech instruments. They collect scientific data or information. They take photos. They map the surface of the planet. They study rocks. They study the soil and minerals too.

One tool on Perseverance is a small helicopter. Ingenuity is the name of the helicopter. It could be the first powered vehicle to fly on another planet. The helicopter has cameras to take images of Mars. Scientists will look at Mars from a different point of view. There are things you can not see from rovers on the ground.

Mars has a different atmosphere than Earth. An atmosphere is a layer of gases that surrounds a planet. The gases on Mars are not tightly packed. The atmosphere is thinner. This could change how the helicopter flies. But scientists prepared for this. Ingenuity is very light. It weighs only 1.8 kilograms (4 pounds). Its blades are large. They spin really fast. This will help Ingenuity create enough lift to fly.

Years In The Making

People have sent technology to Mars for 50 years. Viking 1 and 2 were two NASA spacecraft. They were the first spacecraft to land on Mars. They landed in 1976.

Later, scientists began sending rovers that could move. Perseverance is the fifth rover to land on Mars. The others were Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity.

Humans On Mars?

Only robots have explored Mars so far. But this could change in your lifetime. People are working on sending humans to Mars. And missions like Perseverance will help make it possible.

A small helicopter flew on Mars on April 19. It was the first time humans flew an aircraft on another planet. The helicopter flew for about 30 seconds. It hovered about 3 meters (10 feet) above the ground.

The helicopter is named Ingenuity. It went to Mars in February 2021. It was on the bottom of NASA's Perseverance rover. The rover is a moving robot. It will gather information about Mars. Scientists will use this information to learn more about Mars.

Studying Mars

Mars is called the red planet. That's because its soil is red. Humans have been sending robots to Mars for more than 40 years. The Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers arrived in 1976. But they couldn't move around on the planet.

Later, people sent rovers. They could move around. Some rovers are Spirit, Curiosity, and Perseverance.

Perseverance landed in February. You can watch a video of the landing here. After landing, the rover took pictures. It also recorded sound of the Mars environment. Then, it looked for a good spot for the helicopter to land.

Image 2. Photos taken from Perseverance show Ingenuity taking flight. Photo: NASA/ JPL-Caltech
Getting Off The Ground

The helicopter had some work to do before it could fly. It had to recharge its solar batteries. These are batteries that get energy from the sun. Next, the helicopter had to separate from Perseverance. Then it did some tests. This was to make sure everything worked.

This process was scheduled to happen over six solar days. A solar day is also called a sol. It is how long a day lasts on Mars. Sols are about 24 hours and 40 minutes. Earth days are 24 hours long. The original flight date was delayed. This was due to a software glitch. It caused problems for the helicopter's flight control system.

People at NASA worked on the helicopter for years. "We wanted to see if we could fly on Mars," says MiMi Aung. She is a project manager for the helicopter. She works at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It is in California.

Image 3. Flying on Mars presents new challenges. The atmosphere on Mars is 99 percent less dense than Earth's, making it more difficult for the helicopter to achieve lift. Graphic: Newsela staff.
Flying On Another Planet

Flying on Mars is very different than flying on Earth. The red planet has strong dust storms. It gets less sunlight. And at night, it gets very cold.

Then there is the question of flight. To fly, an aircraft has to balance four forces. A force is a push or pull in a specific direction. The four forces are lift, thrust, drag, and weight. Lift holds an aircraft in the air. It happens when the blades of a helicopter move through the air. It is an upward force. It must be larger than the weight of the helicopter.

We have these forces on Earth, too. But they are different on Mars. There is less gravity than on Earth. Gravity is the force that pulls things toward each other. Plus, the atmosphere on Mars is much less dense. An atmosphere is a layer of gases around a planet. Dense means how tightly packed particles are. The air on Mars is "thin." It is hard to get enough lift.

To help it fly, scientists made the helicopter small. They also made it light. Ingenuity weighs 1.8 kilograms. That is 4 pounds. Its two helicopter blades spin 2,500 times a minute. That helps make lift.

This was Ingenuity's first flight. But it might not be the last. Ingenuity has five flights planned in total.

This was Ingenuity's first flight. But it might not be the last. Ingenuity has five flights planned in total.

A small helicopter flew on Mars on April 19. It was the first time humans flew an aircraft on another planet. The helicopter flew for about 30 seconds. It hovered about 3 meters (10 feet) above the ground.

The helicopter is named Ingenuity. It went to Mars in February 2021. It was on the bottom of NASA's Perseverance rover. The rover is a moving robot. It will gather information about Mars. Scientists will use this information to learn more about Mars.

Studying Mars

Mars is called the red planet. That's because its soil is red. Humans have been sending robots to Mars for more than 40 years. The Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers arrived in 1976. But they couldn't move around on the planet.

Later, people sent rovers. They could move around. Some rovers are Spirit, Curiosity, and Perseverance.

Perseverance landed in February. You can watch a video of the landing here. After landing, the rover took pictures. It also recorded sound of the Mars environment. Then, it looked for a good spot for the helicopter to land.

Getting Off The Ground

The helicopter had some work to do before it could fly. It had to recharge its solar batteries. These are batteries that get energy from the sun. Next, the helicopter had to separate from Perseverance. Then it did some tests. This was to make sure everything worked.

This process was scheduled to happen over six solar days. A solar day is also called a sol. It is how long a day lasts on Mars. Sols are about 24 hours and 40 minutes. Earth days are 24 hours long. The original flight date was delayed. This was due to a software glitch. It caused problems for the helicopter's flight control system.

People at NASA worked on the helicopter for years. "We wanted to see if we could fly on Mars," says MiMi Aung. She is a project manager for the helicopter. She works at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It is in California.

Flying On Another Planet

Flying on Mars is very different than flying on Earth. The red planet has strong dust storms. It gets less sunlight. And at night, it gets very cold.

Then there is the question of flight. To fly, an aircraft has to balance four forces. A force is a push or pull in a specific direction. The four forces are lift, thrust, drag, and weight. Lift holds an aircraft in the air. It happens when the blades of a helicopter move through the air. It is an upward force. It must be larger than the weight of the helicopter.

We have these forces on Earth, too. But they are different on Mars. There is less gravity than on Earth. Gravity is the force that pulls things toward each other. Plus, the atmosphere on Mars is much less dense. An atmosphere is a layer of gases around a planet. Dense means how tightly packed particles are. The air on Mars is "thin." It is hard to get enough lift.

NASA has a new rover named Perseverance. It landed on Mars on February 18, 2021. Mars is a neighboring planet in our solar system. The rover is a robotic vehicle. It is looking for signs of life on Mars. It will also collect soil and rocks.

But the rover has another job. It has a small helicopter named Ingenuity on board. It only weighs 1.8 kilograms. That is 4 pounds. The rover has to help Ingenuity. It has to help it get off the ground. If all goes well, Ingenuity could lift off on Mars as soon as April 8.

Getting Ready

Ingenuity is not ready to fly yet. Perseverance is storing the helicopter in its belly. The rover has to take the helicopter to the flight zone. Then, the rover will set Ingenuity down.

Ingenuity will start charging its batteries. It uses solar panels. These are devices. They change energy from the Sun into electricity. Then, NASA will check the computers on the helicopter.

After all that, Ingenuity will be ready for flight. NASA plans to make five short flights. They will happen over the course of a month.

Exploration By Air

Flying Ingenuity will be historic. It will be the first powered aircraft to fly on another planet. Scientists wanted to honor another first flight. So they put a piece of fabric on the helicopter. The fabric is from Flyer 1.

Flyer 1 is an airplane. It is more than a hundred years old. The Wright Brothers invented it. The airplane had fabric wings and wooden propellers. There was an engine that used gas.

The Wright Brothers flew the plane in December 1903. It was the first powered flight on Earth. And Ingenuity will fly a piece of it on Mars.

Flying Robots

Scientists hope that Ingenuity's flights will work. They would be able to see more of Mars. Rovers cannot go over very rocky areas. The robots could fall over. But helicopters could. They could take pictures. One day there might be other tools on board. The tools could collect more information.
