Pterodactyl?
Written by Stephen Cosgrove Illustrated by Carolyn LaPorte
There once was a very rare creature called a pterodactyl.
She had big, leathery wings.
She had a big, bony beak.
But her name she could barely speak.
Her name was Pterodactyl.

The pterodactyl couldn’t say “Pterodactyl.”
The word got caught between her beak and tongue.
She would take a big breath. She would scrunch up her beak and blurt, “Patero Whack Datal!”
Now, if you can’t say your name, it is very hard to meet someone new. One day, as she was flying along, she met a duck.
The duck said, “Hi, I’m Duck.
Who are you?”

“Hi, I’m Wren. Who are you?”

It was the first Friday in November Daylight Saving Time ended that Sunday.
The fall parade was Sunday, too. Remember to set your clocks back an hour on Saturday night,” said Nolas teacher.
Spring forward, fall back,” he added.
What Is Daylight Saving Time (DST)?
Many countries use some kind of daylight saving program in order to save electricity. In the United States, people in DST states "spring forward" in March. That means they set their clocks forward an hour. As a result, the Sun rises an hour later and sets an hour later. In November, they do just the opposite ("fall back"), and the Sun sets earlier.
Fall Forward, Spring Back • Level J
Nola didnt pay much attention.
She was always late for everything
anyway.
She figured she always would be.
At dinner, though, she asked her mom if they could go to the parade.
I won’t be here Sunday, but I’ll bet Pablo could take you" Mom said. Nola looked at Pablo, her sleepy big brother.
He nodded—and yawned.

Saturday morning, their mom drove to the airport.
Saturday night, Nola thought back to her teacher’s words: “Spring forward, fall back•”
〇「was it “Fall forward, spring back”?

Fall forward" sounded better, so she set her clock forward an hour Just like that, it was past her bedtime. She was late again.

The next morning when Nolci woke， her clock said 10:15.

Nola and Pablo ran to the parade route, but there was no parade.
It seemed they’d missed the whole thing.
They turned and headed home.

On their way back, they spotted their neighbor Frank.
He was climbing around next
to an eight-foot pumpkin float.
The early bird gets the worm!” he shouted, then asked for their help. They worked on his float for more than an hour.
Then Frank clapped his hands.
Let’s get to that parade!” he cried
Nola and Pablo blinked in confusion.
Wait a minute" Nola said.
Wasn’t the parade at ten o’clock
today?” she asked
Was at ten?" Frank asked.
Will be at ten is more like it!" he cried.
He thrust his watch toward them.
It said 9:30.

She had jumped forward an hour when everybody else had jumped back.
That meant she and Pablo were now two hours ahead of everybody else.

It was all a big mistake, but it turned out to be a great mistake. It’s why they「ode in the parade

All About Kites • Level K
Introduction
A kite is one of the oldest toys. And it's very simple to make. Kites come in many sizes, shapes, and colors. Did you know that kites can be both toys and tools?
Kites were named after the kite bird. The kite bird has wide wings and easily floats high in the sky- No one knows who made the first kite. But one famous Chinese story about a kite was written over 2,000 years ago- The story is about a man who used a kite to attack a fort- He couldn't find a way to get inside the fort- So he tied himself to a huge kite-He flew over the wall of the fort and scared the soldiers!

The inventor Ben Franklin had the idea that lightning was made of electricity. He wanted to prove his idea- One day when it was stormy, he tied a metal key to a kite string. Then he flew the kite up into the storm clouds- Lightning from the storm hit his kite. The electricity ran down the wet string to the metal key. When he reached for the key, he got a surprise. The electricity jumped from the key and gave him a shock! Do not try this yourself. It's not safe to do. When Ben Franklin tried to do it again, he was hurt badly-

Many Uses for Kites
Some people have used kites for fishing. They put a fishhook and bait on the long kite tail. The kite tail dragged in the water. When a fish saw it, it bit the bait and was caught on the hook- Then the kite was pulled in.

Years ago, some armies used kites with cameras to spy on enemy troops. Kites were also used as flying targets. The kites trained soldiers to aim better. Soldiers shot at
the kites. The moving

Different shapes of kites fly in different ways. Flat, diamond-shaped kites fly easily- Box-shaped kites can hang still in the air for a long time.
Stunt kites twist and twirl on many strings. Large parafoil kites act almost like parachutes- Giant dragon kites flutter.
Fighting kites can be used to cut other kites' strings-
Make Your Own Kite
You’ll need:



two lightweight, smooth sticks, one 3 feet (90 cm) long, the other 2 feet (60 cm)
a large plastic trash bag, cut open
a long strip of lightweight cloth

or plastic for the tail
scissors


strong tape a very long string

Step
Form a cross shape with the sticks. Wrap tape around the sticks where they meet
12
Step 2:
Cut off a 4-foot (120 cm) piece of string. Tape each end of the string to each end of the long stick. This string is called the bridle. Tie one end of the rest of the string to the middle of the bridle.
Step 3:
Lay the cross on the open plastic bag. Cut a diamond shape around it. Make sure to cut the diamond shape wider than the ends of the sticks.

Step 4:
Fold the corners of the diamond over the ends of the sticks. Tape the corners tightly to the sticks.
Step 5:
For a tail； tape the strip of cloth or plastic to the bottom of the kite.
Kite Safety

•	Don’t fly it near power lines.
•	Keep it away from trees, roads, and airports.
•	DorVt fly a kite in the rain or when you hear thunder
•	Be sure nothing is on the ground
to trip over
On a breezy day, take your kite to a flat, open area- Be sure that there are no power lines or big trees- Look at the ground around you. Is there anything you could trip over? Hold your kite up by the bridle and run into the wind-Let go of the kite and slowly let out some string. Then let out a little more until your kite is high in the sky.
Happy flying!

Even though my family lives in the city, our backyard is like a farm. We have a dog and three chickens- The chickens live in a coop we made with wood we found in the alley-

In the beginning, chicks often need a heat lamp (top left). A young Savannah beams with a very young Sleepy in her lap (top right). Twinkle, Scott Jr.# and Sleepy search the grass for food (bottom).
We bought our chickens at a feed store when they were chicks- We named them Sleepy, Twinkle, and Scott Jr. (Sleepy got her name because she always fell asleep in our hands.) At first, the chicks had to live in a box with a heat lamp to keep warm. Soon they were ready to move out to their coop-

Twinkle lays the larger green eggs. Scott Jr. and Sleepy lay the tan and pink ones.

I also like the sounds that the

When people break the laws, they may go to court. In court, a judge or a jury decides whether someone broke the law. A judge is the head of the court. A jury is a group of people from the community.
The jury listens to both sides and decides whether someone broke the law. Sometimes there is no jury, and the judge decides. If the judge or jury decides that someone broke the law, the judge decides the punishment.
Other Jobs in the Community
Other people in the government also help the community- Firefighters put out fires and help people get away from fires. Emergency workers help people who are sick or hurt. They may take people to a hospital.

Even though my family lives in the city, our backyard is like a farm. We have a dog and three chickens- The chickens live in a coop we made with wood we found in the alley-

In the beginning, chicks often need a heat lamp (top left). A young Savannah beams with a very young Sleepy in her lap (top right). Twinkle, Scott Jr.# and Sleepy search the grass for food (bottom).
We bought our chickens at a feed store when they were chicks- We named them Sleepy, Twinkle, and Scott Jr. (Sleepy got her name because she always fell asleep in our hands.) At first, the chicks had to live in a box with a heat lamp to keep warm. Soon they were ready to move out to their coop-

Our dog, Trixie, is kind to the chickens. She even lets them eat her dog bones! Once a coyote showed up in the alley behind our house- Trixie barked to keep the chickens safe-

Our chickens depend on us to take good care of them. We keep their coop clean and fill their nesting boxes with soft bedding. In the summer, we hang a screen on their coop to keep out the hot sun.

Each afternoon, our chickens eat grass, bugs, and pebbles in the yard- Chickens don't have teeth— eating pebbles helps them grind up their food- We feed the chickens corn pellets and table scraps, too. They really like grapes and watermelon.

When Scott Jr. gets wet# she looks like she's wearing hair gel...well, feather gel.
The chickens love to go outside when it rains- The wet soil is a good place to find insects and slugs. When Scott Jr. gets wet in the rain, her feathers stand up like spiky hair. She looks so funny!

Twinkle lays the larger green eggs. Scott Jr. and Sleepy lay the tan and pink ones.
My favorite part about having chickens is seeing what color eggs they lay. Sometimes the shells are tan. Sometimes they are light pink or green. We eat the eggs for breakfast.

I also like the sounds that the
chickens make when they lay their eggs- They say things like /7rah, rah and "bah-bock, bah-bock!〃 When
//
we hear the sounds, we know that more eggs are on the way-

Did you know there are more than 100 breeds of chickens? Each breed has its own specialty- For example, Rhode Island Reds are known for laying lots of eggs. Silkies are small and have soft, fluffy feathers. Different breeds can live together in the same group, or flock-
One day, our chickens escaped from the yard. We found them under a bush behind our house. We were so happy to see them! We sprinkled their favorite seeds on the ground to lead them back to the coop-

Of course Frank knew his name was Francis and that Frank was just his nickname- His parents called him Frank, and all his friends did, too. Bobby, though, who was new in school, yelled out to the whole class that Francis was a girl's name!

Acadia National Park • Level L
The Sun rises on Acadia's rocky coast.
First to See the Sun
Acadia National Park is one of the first places in the United States to see the Sun rise. Look on a map and you'll understand why.
Maine stretches farther east than any of the other forty-nine states. Acadia has tall peaks that catch the first rays of sunlight.
Land That Meets the Sea
More than two million people visit Acadia National Park each year. The park packs a lot into a small space: beautiful coastline, islands, forests, lakes, and rocks-
Acadia’s water, rocks, and trees are all part of its beauty.

Here, mountains rise from the
sea. At 1,530 feet (466 m), Cadillac
Mountain is the tallest- Because of its amazing view, it's also the most crowded.
Acadia has more than 40 miles (64 km) of coastline- During low tides, the ocean leaves behind pools of water. Inside these pools live sea stars, sea cucumbers, hot pink seaweed, and more.

Acadia is one of the best birdwatching spots in the country—
338 kinds of birds have been seen there. Each autumn, thousands of raptors fly over Acadia as they migrate from Canada for the winter.

A scientist puts a metal band on a peregrine chick. Leg bands mark birds so that scientists can study what they do and where they go.
Return of the Falcon
Peregrine falcons are one of the fastest animals on Earth. Long ago, they nested on Acadia's mountains. Their speed didn't save them from humans, though, whose actions killed many of them. By the 1960s# peregrine falcons were gone from the park.
For years, Acadia worked to bring the falcons back. In 1991, the park saw its first falcon chicks in thirty-five years. Since then, chicks have been born in the park every year.

Compared to many national parks, Acadia is not very big. It doesn't have many big mammals, either. It has lots of small mammals, though, such as foxes and porcupines.

A Park Made Piece by Piece
The most amazing fact about Acadia may be that it became a national park at all.
In the western United States, most national parks were created from public land- That's land that belongs to the government—and, in a sense, to every American. By the early
1900s, the West already had a number of national parks-
Big Park, Little Park
Wrangell-St. Elias in Alaska is the biggest national park in the United States. Alaska is huge, and few people live there. It#s easier to set aside land when nobody owns it.
Compare the sizes of these two national parks. Think how many Acadias would fit inside of Wrangell-St. Elias!

In the East, though, things were different- Settlers had been there longer. Much of the East was divided into little pieces and owned by different people- That includes Maine-
After it became a state in 1820, more and more people discovered the beauty of its rocky coastline- Rich people bought land there and built fancy summer homes.

Rich people built large homes along the Maine coast. This one belonged to George Dorr.
12
Some people wanted to protect the area's beauty, though. One of these was George Dorr. He and others began to donate their bits of land to the government- In 1919, that land became a national park-
The Story of Dorr
George Dorr lived alone in a grand house on Mount Desert Island. In order to protect the area, he slowly bought bits of land, then turned around and donated them. By the time he died in 1944, he had spent all his money, but Dorr had made his dream come true. Acadia had become a national park. In fact, it was still growing like a patchwork quilt, piece by piece. Even today, landowners continue to donate land around Acadia.

The Nile River brings water to Egypt's farms and cities.
Introduction
Thousands of years ago, a group of people lived in the African country of Egypt. They lived on the banks of the Nile River. They were farmers and hunters- They used the river for boat travel- They were ruled by a king called a pharaoh.
4
Beliefs
The ancient Egyptians believed that after someone died, he or she went to live in another world- They believed that a person's next life would be like their present life. They thought the dead person would need the same tools and objects in their next life- So people were buried with many of the things that they owned-
Paintings in a tomb show scenes of the next life.

Pyramids
The king was buried inside a huge stone structure called a pyramid-The pyramid was shaped to look like the Sun's rays shining on Earth. People believed that the king would go to heaven on the rays of the Sun.

Pyramids took many years to build-When a king was still alive, people began building his pyramid- The stones used to make the pyramid were huge. It took hard work to get the stones out of the ground. It took harder work to move the stones to where the pyramid would be built. Some stones were moved on boats-Other stones were moved over land using big sleds.
The Egyptians sailed heavy stones down the Nile River.
Ancient Egypt • Level L

Inside the pyramid was a tomb-This was a special room where the king's body was placed. Many objects were put in the tomb. There were statues, paintings, and many gold things.
Tomb of King Tutankhamun (King Tut)

Drawing of the tunnels and passageways in a pyramid
Many hidden tunnels and rooms were built inside a pyramid. They were built to trick anyone who tried to steal things from the tomb-Giant stones were put in front of the doorway of the real tomb. They were used to keep out thieves- Still, almost every king’s tomb has been robbed over the years. But the pyramids still stand.

The Great Pyramid at Giza is a famous pyramid- It was built for King Khufu. It has more than two million blocks of stone- Other pyramids near it were built for the king’s relatives. A statue called the Sphinx guards all of the pyramids-The Sphinx has the face of a king and the body of a lion.

Conclusion
Studying the ancient Egyptians teaches us a lot about life long ago-We can learn about the tools these people used and clothes they wore-We can learn about the food they ate and the gods they worshipped-By studying ancient Egyptians, we know that they had a great culture-

It was the first Friday in November Daylight Saving Time ended that Sunday.
The fall parade was Sunday, too. Remember to set your clocks back an hour on Saturday night,” said Nolas teacher.
Spring forward, fall back,” he added.
What Is Daylight Saving Time (DST)?
Many countries use some kind of daylight saving program in order to save electricity. In the United States, people in DST states "spring forward" in March. That means they set their clocks forward an hour. As a result, the Sun rises an hour later and sets an hour later. In November, they do just the opposite ("fall back"), and the Sun sets earlier.

Nola didnt pay much attention.
She was always late for everything
anyway.
She figured she always would be.
