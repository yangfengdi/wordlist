Washington, D.C., is building a new bridge. It is called the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge. It will open next spring. It is different from other bridges in the city. It has three pairs of big arches. They soar over the Anacostia River.

The new bridge is named for Frederick Douglass. He was born into slavery, but escaped. Douglass became one of this country's greatest and most respected writers. The bridge replaces an old one.

The old Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge opened in 1950. Back then, states and cities built many new roads and bridges. They did not spend extra money to make the bridge beautiful.

What makes a bridge beautiful or ugly? People have different opinions. Many people find the Arlington Memorial Bridge and the Key Bridge beautiful. Both cross Washington, D.C.'s Potomac River. Each was built in a traditional way. The road is supported by arches below it. Each offers nice views of the city and has lovely stone and carvings. The shape of their arches reminds people of music or dance.

The new bridge uses its arches differently. Heavy cables are hung from the high arches. They help support the road below. It is like the way a swing set's ropes hold the seat you sit on. The metal arches have concrete supports. It looks as if they flow straight up from the river into the sky.

People who care about bridges are excited. The bridge is better designed for walkers and cyclists. There will be paths and river views under the bridge, too.

When finished, the bridge will help connect the parks along the Anacostia River. A larger green space will be formed on both sides of the river. More people might begin to appreciate Washington, D.C.'s rivers.

More Washington, D.C., Bridges
The Arlington Memorial Bridge was finished in 1932. The bridge connects the Lincoln Memorial to Arlington National Cemetery. U.S. military leaders are buried at Arlington.

The Arlington Bridge also connects Washington, D.C., to Virginia. During the Civil War, Virginia separated from the Union. It fought to keep slavery. Many people saw the bridge as a symbol. It represented the North and South coming together again. Black Americans still did not have full civil rights, though. Arlington's bridge is made of concrete. Beautiful stone panels cover it.

The Key Bridge opened in 1923. It was named for Francis Scott Key. He wrote the words that became the national anthem. The bridge looks modern. Its concrete arches are not decorated. It uses a spandrel arch. This type of arch does not fill in the space between the round arch shape below and the roadway above.

Four new astronauts flew to the International Space Station (ISS) on April 24. The ISS circles the Earth. Astronauts from around the world live on the space station. They run experiments there. The experiments help us learn more about outer space.

The four new astronauts brought the total number of people onboard the station to 11. It is the biggest group in space in more than 10 years. These astronauts come from four countries: the United States, Russia, Japan, and France. They were all able to fit in a video call. The astronauts called their space agencies.

"I believe you have brought courage and hope for all of us," said Hiroshi Yamakawa to the astronauts. Yamakawa is the president of the Japanese Space Agency. He called in from Japan.

SpaceX
The four new astronauts left Earth on April 23. They left from the Kennedy Space Center. It is in Florida. The astronauts flew a capsule. A capsule is a small spacecraft. It carries people into space.

The astronauts arrived at the station after one day of traveling. The capsule docked with the station autonomously. This means that it linked up with the space station. It did this without any control from humans.

The four new astronauts will live on the station. They will stay for six months. They replaced a different crew of astronauts. That crew returned to Earth in their own capsule on May 2. The new crew is currently living with three other astronauts on the station.

The new astronauts flew in a capsule named Dragon. SpaceX made the capsule. SpaceX is a private company. It builds reusable spaceships.

This year, SpaceX sent three capsules to the station. This was the third trip. It was the first to use a crew capsule that has gone to space before. These ships are part of a bigger plan. SpaceX wants to send humans to the moon and Mars. They will fly on these reusable ships.

A Bit Of A Crowd
Thomas Pesquet is an astronaut. He is from France. Pesquet was on board the most recent SpaceX flight. But he has lived on the station before.

Pesquet said that the space station has changed. He was last there four years ago. Now, the station is home to more spacecraft. It is home to more people, too. However, the record for the most space station visitors is 13. This record was set in 2009.

Four new astronauts flew to the International Space Station (ISS) on April 24. The ISS circles the Earth. Astronauts from around the world live on the space station. They run experiments there. The experiments help us learn more about outer space.

The four new astronauts brought the total number of people onboard the station to 11. It is the biggest group in space in more than 10 years. These astronauts come from four countries: the United States, Russia, Japan, and France. They were all able to fit in a video call. The astronauts called their space agencies.

"I believe you have brought courage and hope for all of us," said Hiroshi Yamakawa to the astronauts. Yamakawa is the president of the Japanese Space Agency. He called in from Japan.

SpaceX
The four new astronauts left Earth on April 23. They left from the Kennedy Space Center. It is in Florida. The astronauts flew a capsule. A capsule is a small spacecraft. It carries people into space.

The astronauts arrived at the station after one day of traveling. The capsule docked with the station autonomously. This means that it linked up with the space station. It did this without any control from humans.

The four new astronauts will live on the station. They will stay for six months. They replaced a different crew of astronauts. That crew returned to Earth in their own capsule on May 2. The new crew is currently living with three other astronauts on the station.

The new astronauts flew in a capsule named Dragon. SpaceX made the capsule. SpaceX is a private company. It builds reusable spaceships.

This year, SpaceX sent three capsules to the station. This was the third trip. It was the first to use a crew capsule that has gone to space before. These ships are part of a bigger plan. SpaceX wants to send humans to the moon and Mars. They will fly on these reusable ships.

A Bit Of A Crowd
Thomas Pesquet is an astronaut. He is from France. Pesquet was on board the most recent SpaceX flight. But he has lived on the station before.

Pesquet said that the space station has changed. He was last there four years ago. Now, the station is home to more spacecraft. It is home to more people, too. However, the record for the most space station visitors is 13. This record was set in 2009.
